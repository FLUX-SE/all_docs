# 5.6.8 XY AB

These two Panning Types will only become available when a _Virtual Room_ is set to
be virtualising a stereo speaker arrangement (see section 6.52) - they are pan laws
that are derived from widely used dual microphone techniques for rendering
stereo imaging from an omnidirectional scene.

**AB Panning** simulates the recording of the sound scene by a pair of spaced cardioid microphones, pointing laterally at azimuths +/- 55 deg. (elevation 0), with a
distance of 17 cm between the two capsules. Also known as **ORTF**.

**XY Panning** simulates the recording of the sound scene by a pair of microphones in an XY coincident configuration.


> â˜… The aim is to get the same stereo flavour as these dual microphone
> tracking techniques. Try them on close miked sources or any mono
> source, to get a realistic stereo image.
