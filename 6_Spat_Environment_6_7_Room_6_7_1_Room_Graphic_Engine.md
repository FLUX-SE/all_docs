# 6.7.1 Room Graphic Engine

Along with the audio modelling engine, one of Spat's key features is its ability to
model a high definition graphical representation of the virtual space inside each
Room. You can interact and move sources and 'camera view' directly with your
mouse in an intuitive way. Move a source by grabbing its 'emitter' object or in the
case of a grouped source grab any one of the emitters that belong to the group.
Alternatively, sources can be positioned by manipulating their co-ordinate related
source parameter controls (see section 9).
