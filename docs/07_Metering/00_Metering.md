# Metering
All meters display the current signal meter values as solid vertical bars, and the peaks are indicated
with horizontal lines at the corresponding value. <link type="document" target="Peak">Peak</link> hold time
can be adjusted in the settings if necessary. The peak value is also displayed in numeric format at the top
of the meter, which is emphasized in red in case of clipping or overload.

Several meter displays are available, each scrupulously implementing one of the more common and up-to-date
industry norms, as detailed in the following paragraphs.
