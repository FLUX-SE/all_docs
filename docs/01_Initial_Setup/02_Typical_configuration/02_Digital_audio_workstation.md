Any recent computer should be able to run Pure Analyzer smoothly in a stand-alone configuration.
Running your preferred DAW host application alongside with an instance of Pure Analyzer naturally
raises the requirements. Operating in this way will most probably require a dual-screen setup in
order to be able to monitor the Pure Analyzer display and DAW interface simultaneously.
