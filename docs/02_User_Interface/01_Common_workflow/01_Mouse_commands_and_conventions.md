# Mouse commands and conventions
The following mouse click actions are available:
## Left-click
Selects the active
element.
## Right-click
Toggles the display of the corresponding setup menu for the
item beneath the current mouse location.

## Modifier + click
Ctrl-click is equivalent to right-click.

Inside a setup menu item, Alt-click resets the corresponding setting to its default value.

Alt-clicking inside an item, with a zoom factor greater than one, reset the current zoom to full
view (Factor = 1).

## Double-click
Double-clicking on an editable control such as a
slider or text box enters keyboard entry mode, double-clicking again validates the new value.
Double-clicking anywhere inside a panel switches the panel to full-window mode, where the whole
application screen is occupied by the corresponding panel; double-clicking a second time reverts to
the normal layout.

## Click and drag
Clicking + dragging inside an item, with a zoom
factor greater than one, shifts the current scale.

Alt + Clicking + dragging inside an item with a <link type="document" target="Zoom">Zoom</link> Factor,
allow to setup a new zoom according to the defined selection.

current zoom factor is greater than one.
