The layouts are grouped into categories, as described below.

## Studio
For recording and
mastering studio applications, these layouts allow simultaneous monitoring of the spectrum amplitude and
spatial distribution, program level and phase.

## Film mixing
Provide an overview of the
signal amplitude spectrum, phase and and levels.

Film C &amp; D provide Stereo Vector Scope + phase in addition.

## Mastering

Special emphasis is put on controlling program level, spectral equilibrium and spatial image. These layouts all
offer a Nebula / Spatial Spectrogram, a Vector/Surround Scope, Spectrum Amplitude and <link

## Live sound system alignment
These layouts provides the elements needed by the live sound engineer when performing speaker array
calibration tasks, namely delay finder, level meter, transfer function magnitude, phase and coherence
spectra, impulse response, and snapshot facilities.

## Live - Show
These layouts are intended for use by a live sound engineer during the course of a show, allowing for constant 
monitoring of the principal level and spectral indicators of the FOH mix.

## Metering statistics
