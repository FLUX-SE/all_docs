# Basic principles
The global principle and purpose of a spectrum analyzer is to transform an incoming signal, which is
basically a series of amplitudes taken at successive points in time, into a series of values versus
frequency. Transforming an audio signal onto a frequency scale is indeed of great interest for a wide
range of tasks, and notably allows one to display a global, perceptually meaningful and precise picture
of the audio contents.

The display represents the so-called magnitude spectrum of the incoming signal, which is a
two-dimensional curve of the magnitudes of the signal taken at frequencies ranging from 0 (DC) to half
that of the current sampling rate (or Nyquist frequency in signal processing jargon). This is probably
the most commonplace and most easily understood spectrum analyzer visualization, and is the place where
you should start most of the time when you want to inspect the frequency content of your audio material.
