# Block size
Keep in mind that the incoming audio needs to be accumulated in a buffer for a certain amount of time
before the data can be computed and the display updated. In contrast with the buffers you probably know
from soundcards, this block-processing is not just a computer technicality and only a source of
undesirable latency, but an integral part of the process related to the mathematical aspects involved
(<link type="document" target="Time">Time</link>-frequency product uncertainty principle).

As such it determines both the precision of the analysis and the maximum display rate, and should be
adjusted depending on the specifics of your application.

>In order to maintain a sufficiently responsive display refresh rate, blocks overlap by
75 %.

>The default setting is 8192 samples, which corresponds to a length of roughly 180ms at 44.1kHz
sampling rate. This value constitutes a good compromise between precision and responsiveness for most
situations. However, if you need to measure a particular frequency with great precision, you should
raise the analysis block size. On the other hand, if you need to follow rapid spectrum variations, this
value should be lowered.
