# Initial setup
Throughout this manual we will refer to the measured signal processing chain as the <i>system</i> (sometimes
called device under test in electronics literature). This system input is fed with a <i>source</i> signal,
which produces a <i>response</i> signal at its output(s). Both source and response are recorded and
monitored by the analyzer, from which several measurement curves are produced.

The first step is therefore to setup the measurement chain. In case an outboard or plugin device’s
characteristics are to be measured, this is just a matter of routing the inputs and outputs in your DAW.

If you’re measuring the acoustic response of a physical space, you’ll need to place at least one
microphone at the preferred listening position to record the response. The source can either be picked
up directly at the DAW output or recorded with a second microphone placed in front of the
loudspeaker(s), depending on whether you want to include the loudspeaker’s influence or not in the
measurement.
