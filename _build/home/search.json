Each band is individually processed for dynamic. For every frequency band, every dynamic processing section, the compressor, the de- compressor, the expander and the de-expander features its own envelop generator including Dynamic Ratio, Peak amount parameters, L.I.D. (Level independent Detector) and its threshold adjustment. For every frequency band, a transient manager can be inserted pre or post dynamic processing. To achieve a total control on the audio signal, a MS management is available on every frequency band.\nThen all the frequency bands are summed to rebuild a wideband processed signal. A soft clipper featuring a threshold for soft knee, and a dry mix control are available.\nAlchemist gathers in a single plug-in all the Flux science about filtering and dynamic processing."

To start understanding this setting and easily hear it, take a full mixed drum kit or a complete mix with punchy drums, set the compression threshold, ratio to get something near pumping or an aggressive compression.\nThen increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and then toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less compression impression; especially in terms of attack.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the behavior of the Dynamic Ratio is inverted.

It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound “pumping” when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etc…) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumping… In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients.\n\n\n\n\nSets the gain range of the L.I.D. parameter. - Up: Increasing of the L.I.D. action - Down: Decreasing of the L.I.D. action\nThe current L.I.D.

For Expander and DExpander sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) stays inside the area between the two green lines.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the threshold for the processing is determined by the maximum values from RMS/peak detection OR from the signal dynamic detection.

Band\nHold\n\n\nAttack\nRelease\n\n\n\n\n\nDiff. is a key listener for the Difference between input and output signal (at the final output, after the clipper).\nValue Range: Enabled/Disabled\nDefault Value: Disabled\n\n\n\nValue Range: Static BW/Dynamic BW/Flat Sum\nDefault Value: Static BW\nStatic bandwidth provides a constant Q factor, no matter of the gain factor of the filter.

This fundamental design makes it really easy to perform powerful level-independent transparent shaping of the sound spectrum with BitterSweet Pro.\n\n\n\nIn addition to this, BitterSweet Pro is designed with the option to process only a certain part of the frequency spectrum, turning the processing frequency dependent, acting just like a dynamic equalizer.\nWhen Frequency Range is set from 20 Hz to 20 KHz the processing is performed on the full band, now changing the value of the low cut off frequency turns it into a High shelve dynamic eq, setting the high cut off frequency turns it into a Low shelve dynamic eq, and setting both turns it into a peak dynamic eq, in any case the gain can be adjusted with the Static Gain parameter, and the slope can be set with the Frequency Order parameter, from 6dB per octave to 12, 18 and 24 dB, the higher the Frequency Order is the steeper the slope of the frequency response becomes.\nThe detector sidechain is filtered in accordance with the frequency range setting and its low cut, high cut and band pass filter, and the filtered sidechain source can be audited with a simple button click."

    "section": "",
    "text": "About True Peak\nAll digital audio wave signal is ultimately converted back to analog at some point, and while it is often desirable to maximize the overall volume of a signal or a complete mix, care must be taken in order not to go above the digital scale zero decibel ceiling, or nasty distortion and clipping will occur. This common and widely used rule is however not entirely sufficient, as the digital and analog processing involved in a D/A converter does not guarantee that a 0dBfs peak signal will exactly translate to a 0dB peak in the analog domain.\nWithout getting into too much detail, this phenomenon can be attributed to the over-sampling and reconstruction filters present in D/A converters, whose role are to rebuild a continuous time signal from a set of discrete digital values sampled at regularly spaced time intervals. This interpolation process can therefore generate values, which lie above 0dB, and is known as overshoot.\nRelying solely on the peak value of samples can lead to the following problems:\n\nInconsistent readings between successive playbacks of the same material.\nUnexpected overloads of the D/A output converter.\nUnder-readings and beating of pure tones.\n\nUsing True Peak value aims to overcome these limitations by mimicking parts of the D/A conversion process, effectively up-sampling the measured signal, in order to use the true value of peaks that occur in the analog domain."

    "text": "Introduction\nElixir is the improved and revamp version of the legacy Elixir. Such as it, Elixir is a novel kind of program limiter carefully designed to accomplish a truly natural sounding result without changing the nature of the audio material and its timbre, presenting none, or effectively reduced, conventional limiting “pumping” effects even during heavy processing. Now supporting up to 32 channels, 64bits float audio processing and conforming with the ITU-R and EBU loudness norms, Elixir Essential is an indispensable tool for immersive audio productions.\nIt’s a REAL True Peak Limiter, providing a guaranteed True Peak output level according to the ITU-R-BS 1770 or the ITU-R-BS 1770-3, and EBU R128 norms. The algorithm is using an oversampled representation of the audio sample as a reference when it defines the gain envelope; still, the processing is only applied to the original none oversampled data in order to reduce artifacts (like aliasing), and to achieve the most excellent sounding result.\nWorking on 64bits audio processing when the Digital Audio Workstation supports it, Elixir is incredibly easy to achieve great results with: set the input level, adjust ‘Threshold’ according to the amount of limiting you want, and finally enable ‘Make Up’ to compensate the gain and to add loudness - That’s it! There is no need to care about release time or any other conventional limiter settings!\nThere’s an additional feature provided to increase the processing quality in Elixir called ‘Stages’. Stages present the option to set the algorithm to perform the limiting processing in multi-stages, for a limitation more natural and more respectful of the sound material.\n\n\nElixir Session, Elixir Essential\nElixir comes with two different licensing options: - Elixir Session supports up to 2 channels and a sample rate up to 96kHz. - Elixir Essential supports up to 32 channels and a sample rate up to 384kHz\nThe build is the same for both Session and Essential versions, the licensing allowing to use the plug-in as Elixir Session or Essential."

When your user account is successfully activated and the iLok license manager is correctly installed, you can start the license manager software and log in to your iLok user account.\n\n\n\n\nPressing on the sign in button will allow you to connect to your account. After Logging in, you are now ready to transfer any licenses to a computer or to any iLok USB key if you happen to have one. The process of transferring a license is as simple as dragging the license from the Available tab to your Local Computer (or iLok key) on the left side.\nSimply drag your license to your Local Computer or on an iLok USB key. You are now set!\n\nIf you require further information about iLok and managing licenses please refer to iLok.com website\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step is to get the installers for the FLUX:: products you are licensed for. All the software and plugins from FLUX:: are available via our FLUX:: Center software. This is a Mac or Windows application we have created to help keep your FLUX:: products up to date and to give you a clear overview of what you have installed. Firstly, please visit the download section of the FLUX:: Website to get the installer for the FLUX:: Center application.\nOn this page you will find a macOS, a Windows 64 bits, as well as legacy versions for older operating systems. After downloading and installing, you can open the FLUX:: Center applications to begin the process of installing the Elixir.\n!> An authentification is required at the launch of FLUX:: Center. This is the login details of your FLUX shop account which allows you to see only your products licensed for (temporary or permanent)\n\nTo be noted: The binary is the same for either Session and Essential version.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you open FLUX:: Center you will see a page that lists all FLUX:: products available for you to install. You will also find information about which version you have currently installed on your system and which new versions might be available for you to update to. You can select versions to install - or uninstall if necessary - using the pull down menus. If you would like to access more installer options such as your preferred plug-in format, please click on the gear icon to the top right of the header area.\n\n\n\n\nThis preference page will allow you to choose various installation options such as preferred plug-in formats for your system. Choosing your format and returning to the main page by pressing the OK button will show all your install options for software and plugins based on the desired formats chosen.\nIf you would like to be closer to the most current development cycles of the software, you can enable the Beta Versions option. This will give you access to a special set of software installers from the pull down menus on the main FLUX:: Center page. Beta versions are the new builds that are still under development but may contain useful bug fixes and new features. If you find that a beta version is not stable enough for you, then you can always roll back to a stable release version at any time through the FLUX:: Center installers. Note that these versions starts with a “B” where official releases start with a “V”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "About True Peak\nAll digital audio wave signal is ultimately converted back to analog at some point, and while it is often desirable to maximize the overall volume of a signal or a complete mix, care must be taken in order not to go above the digital scale zero decibel ceiling, or nasty distortion and clipping will occur. This common and widely used rule is however not entirely sufficient, as the digital and analog processing involved in a D/A converter does not guarantee that a 0dBfs peak signal will exactly translate to a 0dB peak in the analog domain.\nWithout getting into too much detail, this phenomenon can be attributed to the over-sampling and reconstruction filters present in D/A converters, whose role are to rebuild a continuous time signal from a set of discrete digital values sampled at regularly spaced time intervals. This interpolation process can therefore generate values, which lie above 0dB, and is known as overshoot.\nRelying solely on the peak value of samples can lead to the following problems:\n\nInconsistent readings between successive playbacks of the same material.\nUnexpected overloads of the D/A output converter.\nUnder-readings and beating of pure tones.\n\nUsing True Peak value aims to overcome these limitations by mimicking parts of the D/A conversion process, effectively up-sampling the measured signal, in order to use the true value of peaks that occur in the analog domain."

In addition to just recall (33) the settings for each of the slots individually and alternate between their settings, a morphing slider (35) is provided offering the possibility to morph between the slots and their corresponding settings. When clicking on one of the preset slots (38), the built in preset manager appears.\nThe preset manager contains three preset banks, the Factory bank contains factory presets, this bank is not available for saving of presets but any of the presets can be loaded into a preset slot and then saved into, the User bank, where all user presets are saved. Finally, the Global bank, which is a bit special, here you can save a complete snapshot with all the settings from both preset slots, as well as the position of the morphing slider.\nIn the preset manager, any preset can be loaded into a preset slot by double clicking on the name of the desired preset in the actual preset list, the preset will then be loaded into the preset slot corresponding to the position of the morphing slider.\n\n\n\n\nRecall A loads the selected preset into the corresponding slot.\nRecall B loads the selected preset into the corresponding slot.\nUpdate, saves the current settings into the selected preset.\nNew, saves the current settings into a new preset.\nDuplicate creates a copy of the selected preset and saves it to the list.\nEdit allows for changes to the preset meta properties.\nDelete, removes the selected preset.\nExport, creates a file reflecting the content of the current preset bank.\nImport, allows for import of a preset bank file by adding the imported banks content to the content in the current preset bank.\n\nWhen saving or editing a preset, an option to protect the preset is presented. The preset protection, if engaged, only allows the original preset author to uncheck and edit the preset. This means that you can protect your presets in a multi-user configuration. Protected presets can only be modified using the session used for their creation. If used in another user session they can only be imported or deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save a new preset using the built in preset manager, simply click Save in the corresponding preset slot (A/B), and to save changes to your preset, simply click Save again.\nIf you want to resave your preset under a new name, open the preset manager by clicking the corresponding (A/B) preset slot (38), select New, enter a name for your preset, and press Save.\n\n\n\nRecalls the settings of the corresponding slot.\n\n\n\nTo copy all parameters between the preset slots (A to B or B to A), press the Copy A or Copy B button, and the parameters from the corresponding preset slot will be copied into the current preset slot. When copying parameters from one slot to another, the preset morph slider will automatically slide to the slot the parameters where copied to.\n\n\n\nThe morphing slider provides mixing between the settings of slot A and B and allows for some very creative tweaking.\nThe result of the morphing can be saved as a global preset containing the actual settings of both preset slots as well as the morphing slider position.\nTo save a Global preset, open the preset manager by clicking the corresponding (A/B) preset slot (38), then click Global, select New and enter a name for your global preset, then press Save.\n\n\n\nWhen enabling the Automation control button, the morphing slider will be exposed and available for both automation read and write.\nThough with the button engaged, only the morphing slider value is applied when reading automation.\nThe Automation control button must be engaged if the morphing slider needs to be mapped on a control surface.\n\n\n\nDisplays the name of the current preset.\n\n\n\nBy pressing the little arrows in the preset slot, the built in preset manager appears"

    "text": "Introduction\nElixir v3 is a novel kind of program limiter carefully designed to accomplish a truly natural sounding result without changing the nature of the audio material and its timbre, presenting none, or effectively reduced, conventional limiting “pumping” effects even during heavy processing.\nIt’s a REAL True Peak Limiter, providing a guaranteed True Peak output level according to the ITU-R-BS 1770 and EBU R128 norms. The algorithm is using an oversampled representation of the audio sample as a reference when it defines the gain envelope; still, the processing is only applied to the original none oversampled data in order to reduce artifacts (like aliasing), and to achieve the most excellent sounding result.\nElixir v3 is incredibly easy to achieve great results with, simply set the input level, then adjust ‘Threshold’ according to the amount of limiting you want, and enable ‘Make Up’ to compensate the gain and to add loudness - That’s it! There is no need to care about release time or any other conventional limiter settings!\nThere’s an additional feature provided to increase the processing quality in Elixir v3 called ‘Stages’. Stages present the option to set the algorithm to perform the limiting processing in multi-stages."

In EVO Channel an Arbitrary and Linear Phase Rotation throughout the spectrum is provided, to accomplish the same natural thing as when physically moving a microphone, of course without adding any latency.\n\nThe phase must be enabled for all the drum tracks. Then set the same group number for all these tracks. It allows to enable and disable the phase for all the drums in one click (simply switch on/off for the phase in one of the tracks).\n\n\n\nThe Phase is the result of Flux:: proprietary research, this unique algorithm allows linear phase correction with zero latency.\nActivate the phase module on all of the tracks that were recorded at the same time and in the same room (multi- microphones tracking or live recording in exemple), and then use the slider on the different tracks until you get full control over the phase and everything sounds correct.\nWhen enabled, the phase correction is turned on.\nValue Range : Enabled/Disabled\nDefault Value : Disabled\n\n\n\nAdd an EVO Channel instance to a Phase Group. You can add an instance of EVO Channel to a group, all the members of the same group can then have their Phase enabled or disabled at one and the same time. To do so, add the instance to a group by selecting the group number for the desired group. Now when you then turn the phase switch on or off in any of the instances in the group, this will affect all instances that are members of the same group.\nValue Range : None/Group number\nNumber of groups : 8 groups\nDefault Value : Disabled\n\n\n\nSet the shift value used to correct the phase.\nValue Range : -180° / 180°\nDefault Value : 0°\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, polarity inversion is applied to the signal.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Disabled\n\n\n\n\nOne of the corner stones in a Channel Strip is a well-built, efficient and complete Equalizer.\nThe EVO Channel EQ is a straightforward comprehensive 4-band equalizer with additional 6-24 dB Hi/Lo filters.\nThe graphical interactive EQ curve is layered on top of the built in Spectrum Analyzer for hands-on editing with direct connection to the visual response.\nBuilt with our proprietary State-Space technology, like in Epure, the EQ section has been carefully tuned to preserve the optimal signal to noise ratio independent of the parameter settings preventing the signal from deteriorating when the gain is reduced. It’s an efficient sharp-edged surgical precision tool for the most demanding equalizing and filtering tasks conceivable.\nEqualization module is divided in two parts : - A filtering part composed of a low cut, a low shelf, a high cut and a high shelf filter. - A parametric equalization stage made of four parametric EQs.\n\n\n\nEnables the low cut filter.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Enabled\n\n\n\nCutoff frequency of the low cut filter.\nValue Range : 20Hz to sampling rate / 2\nDefault Value : 20Hz\n\n\n\nSlope of the low cut filter.\nValue Range : 6dB/oct - 24dB/oct\nDefault Value : 6dB/oct\n\n\n\nEnables the low shelf.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Enabled\n\n\n\nCutoff frequency of the low shelf.\nValue Range : 20Hz / 22050Hz\nDefault Value : 100Hz\n\n\n\nTarget gain for frequencies below the cutoff frequency.\nValue Range : -24.0dB / +24.0dB\nDefault Value : 0.0dB\n\n\n\nEnables the high cut filter.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Enabled\n\n\n\nCutoff frequency of the high cut filter.\nValue Range : 20Hz to sampling rate / 2\nDefault Value : Sampling rate / 2\n\n\n\nSlope of the high cut filter.\nValue Range : 6dB/oct - 24dB/oct\nDefault Value : 6dB/oct\n\n\n\nEnables the high shelf.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Enabled\n\n\n\nCutoff frequency of the high shelf.\nValue Range : 20Hz to sampling rate / 2\nDefault Value : 5000Hz\n\n\n\nTarget gain for frequencies above the cutoff frequency.\nValue Range : -24.0dB / +24.0dB\nDefault Value : 0.0dB\n\n\n\nEnables the corresponding parametric equalizer.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Enabled\n\n\n\nGain stage of parametric equalization.\nValue Range : -24.0dB / +24.0dB\nDefault Value : 0.0dB\n\n\n\nCenter frequency of parametric equalization.\nValue Range : 20Hz to sampling rate / 2\nDefault Value : Default value depends of the equalizer used.\n\nLow parametric equalizer : 200Hz\n\nMid-Low parametric equalizer : 500Hz\n\nMid-High parametric equalizer : 1300Hz\n\nHigh parametric equalizer : 2500Hz\n\n\n\n\nQ value of parametric equalization.

To use a compressor in a creative and artistic fashion it’s important that it’s easy to use and has the ability to create an interesting sound.\nThe EVO Channel’s compressor module is based on the Pure Compressor’s dynamics engine, and the same range of compression types are available in EVO Channel through the different modes available (each mode corresponds to a fine tuning of Pure Compressor). As some modes use a LID compression (Level Independent Detection) in parallel, a gain reduction may be processed even if the audio level is below the threshold.\n\n\n\nThe compressor module gives you up to 9 modes of compression.\nAvailable modes :\n\nStart\nKick/Snare\nOverhead\nDrum Bus\nBass\nAcoustic\nPiano\nVocal\nMix\n\nDefault Value : Start\n\n\n\nThreshold value of the compressor.\nValue Range : -42.0dB / +18.0dB\nDefault Value : Depends on the Mode.\n\n\n\nCompression ratio parameter.\nValue Range : 1.0:1 / 10.0:\nDefault Value : Depends on the Mode.\n\n\n\nAttack value of the compressor.\nValue Range : 0.1ms / 1000.0ms\nDefault Value : Depends on the Mode.\n\n\n\nRelease value of the compressor.\nValue Range : 1ms / 10000ms\nDefault Value : Depends on the Mode.\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, the compressor adapts its release time to the input signal depending on the audio signal, but won’t exceed the release time value.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Enabled\n\n\n\nDisplays the gain reduction performed by the compressor.\nValue Range : 0dB / -24dB\n\n\n\nGain stage at the output of the compressor module.\nValue Range : 0.0dB / 24.0dB\nDefault Value : 0.0dB\n\n\n\nWet parameter defines how much of the compressed signal is mixed with the original signal, for parallel compression.\nValue Range : 0% / 100%\nDefault Value : 100%\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of material require different tools, whether it’s a vocal cut, drums, guitar, piano or something else, it requires the accurate specific treatment for the material.\nThe Touch module in EVO Channel is a polymorphic section offering a variety of different processors designed to adapt to the requirements of the material, with seven different processing modes including a DeEsser, Expander and a Transient and Sustain Designer.\nWith the adjustable signal flow in EVO Channel the Touch module can be inserted where it’s best doing its job, like having the DeEsser or Expander first in the flow, or the Transient designer after the compressor.\n\n\n\nMode parameter defines the processor used by the touch module. Seven different modes are provided.\nAvailable modes :\n\nTransient Boost\nTransient Kill\nSustain Boost\nSustain Kill\nDeEsser 1\nDeEsser 2\nExpander\n\nDefault Value : DeEsser 2\n\n\n\nThe amount of signal processed by the Touch module.\nValue Range : 0% / 100%\nDefault Value : 0%\n\n\n\nThere is a release parameter for the following modes :\n\nTransient Boost\nTransient Kill\nSustain Boost\nSustain Kill\nExpander\n\nValue Range : 1ms / 1000ms\nDefault Value : 20ms\nThe two deesser modes offers a range parameter, to limit the maximum gain reduction.\nValue Range : 0dB / 24dB\nDefault Value : 12dB\n\n\n\nThe Touch module works on a defined frequency range.\nValue Range :\nMinimal bound : 20Hz\nMaximal bound : Sampling Rate / 2\nDefault Value :\nInferior bound : 3.9kHz\nSuperior bound : up to Sampling Rate / 2\nRange width : Depends on the sampling rate.\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, you can monitor the actual signal setup with the frequency range.\nValue Range : Enabled / Disabled\nDefault Value : Disabled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output gain control trims the level of the signal at the output of EVO Channel. The meter shows both RMS signal (VU-Meter, blue) and peak signal (peak meter, green), from -24 to +18 dB range, referenced at -18dB.\nValue Range : -24.0 dB / +18.0 dB\nColors : - Blue : RMS Value - Green : Peak Value\nDefault Value : 0.0 dB"

Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain.\n\n\nThese Feed Backward modes have been inspired by vintage hardware architectures. they create a sort of auto regulation of the processing which produces a naturally beefy sound. The output volume also control the feedback level.\n\n\n\n\nUnit: ms\nValue Range: 0 ms / 500 ms.\nDefault Value: 0 ms\nThis parameter is the only one in the time related settings, that is independent per dynamic processor. The compressor and the expander may have different hold time.\n\nUsed in the Expander section, this setting allows very precise gating of drum tracks. It can also be used for creative purpose on the other dynamic sections.\n\n\n\n\nUnit: ms\nValue Range: 0.67ms / 5000.00\nStep: 0.01\nDefault Value: 1.30 ms\nSets the minimum release value when in Advanced Mode.\n\n\n\nUnit: x\nValue Range: 0 / 3.0\nStep: variable.\nDefault Value: 1\nAmplify or dim the extracted real time dynamic informations.\n\n\n\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 10 / 1000\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 50 %\nSets the speed of variation on the dynamic informations.\n\n\n\nUnit: Hz\nValue Range: 20 to 24000 Default Value: 20\nFilters out the low-end from the detection circuit.\n\n\n\nUnit: Hz\nValue Range: 20 to 24000 Default Value: 20000\nFilters out the high-end from the detection circuit.\n\n\n\nUnit: dB\nValue Range: 0 to +24\nDefault Value: 0\nSets the smoothness of the transmission curve for the specific dynamic processing section.

To start understanding this setting and easily hear it, take a full mixed drum kit or a complete mix with punchy drums, set the compression threshold, ratio to get something near pumping or an aggressive compression.\nThen increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and then toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less compression impression; especially in terms of attack.\n\n\n\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 0 / 100\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 0 %\nAllows process the audio signal independently of the sound level but regarding the signal dynamic range. It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound ™pumping∫ when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etcº ) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumpingº In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients.\n\n\n\n\nSets the gain range of the L.I.D. parameter.\n\nUp: Increasing of the L.I.D. action\nDown: Decreasing of the L.I.D. action\n\nThe current L.I.D. Threshold value is reflected by two blue lines on the Dynamic Activity display.\nFor Compressor and DCompressor sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) exceeds the area between the two blue lines. For Expander and DExpander sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) stays inside the area between the two blue lines.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the threshold for the processing is determined by the maximum values from RMS/peak detection OR from the signal dynamic detection. The L.I.D. Threshold is still active, but the L.I.D. mix button is disabled.\n\nThis feature allows the whole process to be more reactive to the signal content. It worth to be tried on drum tracks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Slope sets the number of frequency-dependent components controlling the slope of the frequency response. One component, referred to as 1 (First-Order), gives a 6 dB/Octave slope, adding a second component, referred to as 2 (Second-Order), gives a 12 dB/Octave slope etc. The higher the Frequency Order is, the steeper the slope of the frequency response becomes.\nValue Range: 6 / 12 / 18 / 24 - dB Per Octave\nDefault Value: 6 dB/o\n\n\n\nAdjusts the release time for the transient processing envelope.\nValue Range: 0.00 ms / 500.00 ms\nDefault Value: 0.00 ms\n\n\n\nValue Range: Static BW/Dynamic BW/Flat Sum\nDefault Value: Static BW\nStatic bandwidth provides a constant Q factor, no matter of the gain factor of the filter. It’s computed by having a constant bandwidth at +- 3 dB from 0 dB.\nDynamic bandwidth provides a dynamic Q factor, dependent on the gain factor of the filter. It’s computed by having a constant bandwidth at +- 3 dB from peak levels of the filter.\nFlat Sum is a more traditional way of computing the Q factor. The bandwidth is constant for the gain factor divided by two.\n\n\n\nThe Zero Crossing refers to the amount of time the signal crosses the point of an amplitude of zero. It gives an indication on transient detection, as they tend to produce bursts of zero crossing."

Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain.\n\n\nThese Feed Backward modes have been inspired by vintage hardware architectures. they create a sort of auto regulation of the processing which produces a naturally beefy sound. The output volume also control the feedback level.\n\n\n\n\nUnit: ms\nValue Range: 0 ms / 500 ms.\nDefault Value: 0 ms\nThis parameter is the only one in the time related settings, that is independent per dynamic processor. The compressor and the expander may have different hold time.\n\nUsed in the Expander section, this setting allows very precise gating of drum tracks. It can also be used for creative purpose on the other dynamic sections.\n\n\n\n\nUnit: ms\nValue Range: 0.67ms / 5000.00\nStep: 0.01\nDefault Value: 1.30 ms\nSets the minimum release value when in Advanced Mode.\n\n\n\nUnit: x\nValue Range: 0 / 3.0\nStep: variable.\nDefault Value: 1\nAmplify or dim the extracted real time dynamic informations.\n\n\n\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 10 / 1000\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 50 %\nSets the speed of variation on the dynamic informations.\n\n\n\nUnit: Hz\nValue Range: 20 to 24000 Default Value: 20\nFilters out the low-end from the detection circuit.\n\n\n\nUnit: Hz\nValue Range: 20 to 24000 Default Value: 20000\nFilters out the high-end from the detection circuit.\n\n\n\nUnit: dB\nValue Range: 0 to +24\nDefault Value: 0\nSets the smoothness of the transmission curve for the specific dynamic processing section.

To start understanding this setting and easily hear it, take a full mixed drum kit or a complete mix with punchy drums, set the compression threshold, ratio to get something near pumping or an aggressive compression.\nThen increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and then toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less compression impression; especially in terms of attack.\n\n\n\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 0 / 100\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 0 %\nAllows process the audio signal independently of the sound level but regarding the signal dynamic range. It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content.\nHow can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound ™pumping∫ when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels, and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etcº ) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumping. In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients.\n\n\n\n\nSets the gain range of the L.I.D. parameter.\n\nUp: Increasing of the L.I.D. action\nDown: Decreasing of the L.I.D. action\n\nThe current L.I.D. Threshold value is reflected by two blue lines on the Dynamic Activity display.\nFor Compressor and DCompressor sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) exceeds the area between the two blue lines. For Expander and DExpander sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) stays inside the area between the two blue lines.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the threshold for the processing is determined by the maximum values from RMS/peak detection OR from the signal dynamic detection. The L.I.D. Threshold is still active, but the L.I.D. mix button is disabled.\n\nThis feature allows the whole process to be more reactive to the signal content. It worth to be tried on drum tracks."

In EVO In an Arbitrary and Linear Phase Rotation throughout the spectrum is provided, to accomplish the same natural thing as when physically moving a microphone, of course without adding any latency.\n\nThe phase must be enabled for all the drum tracks. Then set the same group number for all these tracks. It allows to enable and disable the phase for all the drums in one click (simply switch on/off for the phase in one of the tracks).\n\n\n\nThe Phase is the result of Flux:: proprietary research, this unique algorithm allows linear phase correction with zero latency.\nActivate the phase module on all of the tracks that were recorded at the same time and in the same room (multi- microphones tracking or live recording in exemple), and then use the slider on the different tracks until you get full control over the phase and everything sounds correct.\nWhen enabled, the phase correction is turned on.\nValue Range : Enabled/Disabled\nDefault Value : Disabled\n\n\n\nAdd an EVO In instance to a Phase Group. You can add an instance of EVO In to a group, all the members of the same group can then have their Phase enabled or disabled at one and the same time. To do so, add the instance to a group by selecting the group number for the desired group.

The solution is to work with a so-called virtual center (equal energy in channels), disabling processing by the Spat for the physical center channel.\n\n\n\nDepending on the Output arrangement setting, choose the method to use for placement of the sources inside the audio space.\nPossible choices are (some will be grayed out depending on your output configuration):\n\nRecursive\nAngular pairwise (default)\nSurround LRS\nSurround LRCS\nBinaural. Intended for stereo reproduction. Prefer transaural output encoding when loudspeakers are to be used.\nVBAP 2D (Vector Base Amplitude Panning).\nAllows for arbitrary placement of the speakers onto a horizontal plane.\nRefer to http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/~ville/ for more information on this technique.\nVBAP 3D\nSame as above, but for a 3D speaker setup.\nDBAP (Distance-Based Amplitude Panning).\nDoes not rely on any assumptions regarding speaker array or listener position, which is good for avoiding sweet spots.\nRefer to http://jamoma.org/papers/icmc2009-dbap.pdf for more information.\nB-Format 2D.\nA basic variant of Ambisonics.

One can then measure and replicate the interaction of the head of a particular listener to recreate a sensation of 3D space. > Please keep in mind this technique is only applicable to the stereo case. The default one available is the Kemar head, a standard Manikin head. Some others are available (choose the HRTF library at install time). Their numbers refers to the anonymous id of the listeners that have sampled their profile at IRCAM laboratories.\n\n\n\nInternally, spatial variations are computed using a kind of 2D-network of reverbs, and this setting toggles between an 8x8 (standard) or 16x16 size (high). The choice of which sounds best is left up to you, as this depends on the source material at hand, although it must be emphasized that the high density consumes a little more CPU and that the color of the reverb can be altered by this setting, particularly at some extreme parameter setting combinations.\n\n\n\nToggles the corresponding speaker output on and off, which can prove useful for checking purposes. In general it is advisable to use your DAW surround mixer capabilities instead, as these are global to your project.\n\n\n\nAn output delay, expressed in milliseconds, can be inserted just before output to the speaker, for example to compensate for a non-standard speaker arrangement. > Please note that if you move a speaker in the source view, the associated delay is automatically applied on the >corresponding output according to the speaker distance."

You’ve most probably noticed this other real-world phenomenon when you’re far away from a concert venue and only able to hear the bass, and gradually start to hear the whole mix as you get closer.\n\n\n\nClear all solo that have been previously engaged on sources.\n\n\n\nOwing to a fundamental law of acoustics and geometry, namely energy conservation, sound pressure drops in level as one moves away from the source. Choose “Log2” for an acoustically accurate setting, which corresponds to a “Drop” value attenuation every time the distance from the source is doubled (logarithmic behaviour), or “Linear”, for a less radical drop law.\n\n\n\nThis value determines the value of the level attenuation in dB (deciBels), according to the selected drop mode. Default is 6dB, which is the physically accurate value.\n\n\n\nSpecifies the radius of a disk, in meters, centered around the listener’s head, where the drop attenuation is not taken into account, and the sound level is kept constant with regards to distance. This is not only useful to prevent any dramatic sound level peak when placing a source too close to the listener, it also reflects real-world behaviour quite accurately, where sources do have a certain physical size, unlike point sources that are commonly used to model far-field acoustics.\nThis “no-drop” zone is displayed as a transparent-blue disk of matching radius on the preview.\n\n\n\nBy default, only early reflections are panned, and the cluster reflections, which form the diffuse part of the early reverberation, are panned dead center. Pan_rev allows you to modify cluster panning, thus imparting some directionality or perceived direction to the diffuse part of the sound.\n\n\n\nControls the width of the sound projection lobe of the early reflections from a source in the virtual acoustic space, in degrees. The minimum setting, 1°, gives a very directional source, whereas 180° makes it omnidirectional."

    "text": "This parameter group holds settings affecting the way the reverb sound is perceived by the listener. As explained previously, these are not simply names stuck onto any internal parameter dictated by the inner workings of the algorithm.\nInstead, a true perceptually-oriented approach was used in the design of the plugin, where a test panel of listeners was presented with a test-set of sounds, constructed from several different variations of the reverb engine inner parameters. The listeners were then asked to rate each set onto a few different scales with perceptually and aesthetically meaningful names. Using principal components analysis (PCA) and optimization techniques, we then built an algorithm which reverses the process and automatically maps a given set of perceptual factor values to the many internal reverb engine parameters.\nAs a general guideline, we encourage you to learn the meaning of these parameters by carefully listening to the audible variations when adjusting them. We do provide a short explanation of each of them below, but training your ears is really the best way to be able to use these in context.\n\n\nSource presence refers to the prominence of the direct sound with respect to the reverberated sound. It is not just equivalent to a dry/wet ratio, and is influenced by other settings such as distance, radius and drop-factor.\n\n\n\nPresence of the low frequency content part of the source.\n\n\n\nPresence of the high frequency content part of the source.\n\n\n\nProminence of the reverberation with respect to the source, or in other words, how much the room sound dominates the overall sound.\n\n\n\nThis parameter controls the amount of perceived reverb when feeding a continuous music message, where the overall sound is a tight blend of the dry and wet signals and the reverb part cannot be mentally separated. It is linked to the early reflections decay time. > Note: this setting is distinct from ‘reverberance’ in the reverb tab.\n\n\n\nEnvelopment corresponds to the the perceived notion of how much the listener feels being surrounded by the ambient sound. In a multichannel configuration, one could describe this as the feeling of being wrapped inside the imaginary “sound sphere” that the listener pictures in his mind. It can also be described as the energy of the early room effect with respect to direct sound.\n\n\n\nThis sub-panel displays the acoustical parameter values associated with the current settings. They are provided for the more technically inclined users who already know how they can make use of them; you can safely ignore them otherwise.\n\nPlease note this is an indicative feature only, as these settings can not directly be changed here.\n\n\nRT60 (Reverberation Time, in seconds): measure of reverberation decay time, namely the time taken by the reverb to drop below -60dB of attenuation.\nEDT (Early Decay Time, in seconds): time to decay to -60dB, derived from a linear fit of the decay curve between 0 and -10dB.

    "text": "The Spat is a very powerful tool for spatialization. It can handle both aspects of spatialization (source localization and room acoustic simulation) in a very homogeneous and coherent way. A set of sources (up to eight in this plug-in, may be linked in stereo pairs) are localized in a 3D space (in the Source control tab). Each of these source is connected to a room (also called reverb).\nUp to 3 rooms are available in parallel, in order to simulate complex spaces (coupled room acoustics…).\n\n\n\nIn both sources edition and reverb edition, controls are available as a set of “perceptual factors”. Each of these parameters corresponds to a real-world criterion that actually has proper significance in terms of hearing perception, and not some obscure algorithm-specific parameter translating more-or-less to some kind of aesthetic interpretation. This is a feature unique to the Spat, which is the result of substantial research and development work at IRCAM and Flux, providing a relationship between these parameters and the plug-in internal parameters. Internally, the plug-in perceptual mapper translates the GUI parameters into a much larger set of parameters required for the actual reverb engine computations.\nThis way the complexities of the reverb algorithm internals are hidden from the user so one can make predictable and guided adjustments, instead of having to resort to a “poke in the dark” approach, adjusting settings at semi-random trying to find some “magical” combination of parameters to obtain the desired result.\nIn parallel, a display is detailing the “acoustical criteria”, these parameters are more familiar for those who are well acquainted with acoustics, and here instead will find the more commonly used terms."

    "text": "For spoken voice it is good practice to playback between 5 to 15 seconds of any new audio material with Learn engaged to let the plug-in adapt to the specifics of the audio material. For singing voice or instrument sounds it is essential that the audio segment that is used covers the complete pitch range that will be processed. Otherwise the internal parameter settings will not achieve optimum quality for the transformation.\n!> Do not forget to switch off learn mode when doing the actual processing, or you may encounter strange behavior!\nNow that you have set the source parameters, here comes the fun part: transforming the source material, according to target parameters. T.R.A.X. allows for a large palette of transformations such as: * Pristine quality up and down pitch-shifting, preserving formant and transient integrity * Re-tuning the material to a fixed-pitch, a given musical scale, etc. * Altering perceived gender, age, etc. * Special effects for sound design and such\n\nIn all of these contexts, unwanted artifacts are kept to a minimum and the natural quality and timbre of voices and instruments are preserved, thanks to the innovative analysis algorithms used.\n\nPlease note, however, that in the case of extreme transformations, the perceived quality of the voice might degrade. We strongly believe this not due to a flaw or a limitation of the algorithms, but more to the fact that the human brain is extremely well trained and sensitive to the perception of voice, with all its intricacies. In other a words, please do not reasonably expect a computer to turn an amateur singer into a seasoned Opera pro or your 5-year old son into the 8 o’clock veteran news presenter. This would involve something much more complex than pitch and formant modification, such as prosody, and some understanding of the meaning of the underlying words or musical emotion conveyed.\n\n\n\nOnly available in Voice Mode, the Target Presets cover a selection of gender and age combinations. Available presets\n\nMan\nWoman\nYoung Man\nYoung Woman\nBoy\nGirl\n\n\n\n\nAvailable in Voice and Instrument Mode, the Target Register presets allow to change the register of the material. Ensure source and target registers match if you want to preserve register.\nRegister is locked to spoken voice when the source is defined as a spoken voice also, as in this case there is no “melody” for the target voice to follow.\n\n\n\nSpoken Voice\nSinging Bass\nSinging Baritone\nSinging Tenor\nSinging Counter Tenor\nSinging Contralto\nSinging Mezzo Soprano\nSinging Soprano\n\n\n\n\n\nUndefined. Only choice available if “Undefined” is selected as Source register.\nBass\nBaritone\nTenor\nCounter Tenor\nContralto\nMezzo Soprano\nSoprano\n\n\n\n\n\nApplies a global transposition, also known as pitch-shift to the incoming audio, expressed in semi–tones. This affects the pitched content only, preserving formant and transient content for the most natural result. An octave shift corresponds to a Transpose factor of 12 semitones.\n\n\n\nApplies a global frequency-shift of the formant content, independently of pitched and transient content.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the Format shift factor is locked onto the transpose factor value, and only the Transpose slider can be moved.\n\n\n\nWhen the inverse button is engaged, the Formant shift amount follows the Transpose factor, in inverse fashion, i.e.  formants are shifted by an amount opposite of the pitch.\n\n\n\nThe VoiceForger sub-section is used for more sophisticating pitch and formant transformations.\nHere the incoming source characteristics extracted by the detection stage are used as input to a series of modifiers. The first possible modifier, F(0), changes the fundamental frequency of incoming notes, “squeezing” them back into a series of reference target intervals, defined by the modes which we explain below, with the Flat<–>Expr. controlling the “tightness” of this “squeeze”.\nThis can be used to correct a less than perfect take, impart a robotic character to a voice, make an instrument sound like a synthesizer, etc.\n\nRecto Tono\nModifies the pitch with regard to the reference mean F0 as defined in the Source parameters, by an amount specified by the Flat<>Expr (FE) control. With FE set to -100% (Flat), no pitch variation remains in the processed sound, which gives a completely monotonous voice, reminiscent of early voice synthesizers.\nRecto Tono (Tuned)\nSame as above, but taking into account the source tuning.\nChromatic\nBrings back the pitch of the notes towards a chromatic, equal-temperament scale.\nMode 1 tr 1 (tone)\nAttracts pitch towards the closest note on a succession of full-tone (2 half-tones) intervals.\nMode 1 tr 2 (tone)\nSame as above, transposed 1 semitone above root key.\nMode 2 tr 1 (tone, semi tone)\nWorks on a succession of intervals made up of groups of a full-tone followed by a semi-tone.\nMode 2 tr 2 (tone, semi tone)\nSame as above, first interval is a semi-tone.\nMode 2 tr 3 (tone, semi tone)\nSame as above, first interval is a tone.\n\n\n\n\nThis controls smoothing of the time-variations of the fundamental frequency. Increasing it will therefore give more progressive note-to-note transitions, for a more “legato” playing type of feel.\n\n\n\nThe Flat <–> Expression knob defines the amount of pitch correction taking place. When set to “Flat” (-100%), this controls how close towards the target reference notes (single note for Recto Tono, chromatic scale, etc.) the fundamental frequency is pulled. Conversely, when set to “Expr.”, it exaggerates the pitch differences with respect from the target reference notes. As you expect, a 0% expression setting leaves the pitch unaffected by this section.\n\n\n\nThis high-level control gradually alters the perceived age of a voice, either sung or spoken.\n\n\n\nThis high-level control gradually alters the perceived gender of a voice, either sung or spoken.\n\n\n\nIncrease the “breathiness” of a voice, or an instrument, making it whisper.\nIncreasing this close to 100% will give you that chain-smoker voice timbre, ala Don Corleone in the Godfather, without the risks and costs involved. You can also use this with a wind instrument to accentuate the breathing sound which gives so much character to a performance.\nThis panel acts as a mini-mixing console where the various components of the audio are sent to and summed-back to the output. It allows for further tweaking of the final result and isolation of each part of the sound, and one can also use this to achieve special effects."

The Source description is used to derive some fundamental processing parameters that are essential for high quality sound analysis and processing.\nThe source signal will be split into three distinct components: * Pitched content * Noise * Transients or onsets\nAnd moreover 2 sets of descriptors are extracted:\n\nThe fundamental frequency and its variation over time\nThe formant and resonator characteristics\n\nBased on these analysis the subsequent transformations will be performed.\nThis analysis being a very sophisticated process is based on decades of research made at IRCAM.\nThe analysis make uses of a little prior information about the source material, namely the range within which the fundamental frequency of the audio is known to vary. This range can be defined in three ways, using high-level to low-level parameter manipulation: * using named presets * using learn mode * manually fine-tuning low-level settings\n\n\nThis setting, only relevant to voice mode, should match the recorded singer’s or speaker’s age and gender.\nAvailable presets: * Man * Woman * Young Man * Young Woman * Boy * Girl\n\n\n\nThe source register setting is only relevant to voice and instrument modes, and should match the source material register as closely as possible.\n\n\nThe following list of registers is available in Voice mode * Spoken Voice * Singing Bass * Singing Baritone * Singing Tenor * Singing Counter Tenor * Singing Contralto * Singing Mezzo Soprano * Singing Soprano\nThe selection of spoken and singing registers changes not only the analysis parameters but also the transformation algorithms that are linked to high level target controls. Transforming Man into Woman with Spoken voice will affect formant structure and pitch, while transforming Man Singing Tenor into Woman Singing tenor will only affect the formant structure.\n\n\n\nThe following list of registers is available in Instrument mode. If you do not know the register of the source, you can resort to manual tuning of the fundamental frequency, and refer to the chart below * Undefined. Default, general setting * Bass * Baritone * Tenor * Counter Tenor * Contralto * Mezzo Soprano * Soprano\n\n\n\n\nThis low-level parameter defines the minimum of the allowed variation range for the source fundamental frequency. When doing manual adjustments, this frequency should roughly be set to that of the lowest note expected in your source material. This parameter determines the window size for monophonic material. Setting it too low may introduce reverberation artifacts, may prevent the detection of fast onsets ,and moreover, may introduce pitch detection errors. Setting it too high will create artifacts in low pitch notes and may as well lead to fundamental frequency estimation error.\n\n\n\nThis low-level parameter sets the expected average fundamental frequency. You can tune this by ear or determine it precisely using the frequency corresponding to the note most often played, for example, or the root key of the song if you know it. This value is used mainly for the ambitus control in recto tono mode.\n\n\n\nMaximum of the allowed variation range for the source fundamental frequency.\n\n\n\nSets the actual reference tuning used in the source material, which is defined as the frequency of A4 in Hertz. The default value is 440Hz, which matches the standard concert tuning almost always used nowadays.\nThis frequency will be used as the reference for transposition; you should therefore adjust it accordingly if your instrument is tuned in a non-standard way, or working with a recording of unknown origin.\n\n\n\nThe Learn button, when engaged, puts the plug-in into fundamental frequency parameter learn mode, wherein the incoming audio is analyzed to refine F0 min, mean and max values. The learn mode is linked to the presets and can be used only to refine preset parameters. It will not work if the selected preset does not match the audio.\n\n\nhttp://www.independentrecording.net/irn/resources/freqchart/main_display.htm"

    "text": "The Mode selection buttons puts the plug-in into the one of three modes, each best suited for one of three different types of audio material: Voice, Instrument and Music, which are explained in detailed below.\nMode serves as a starting point upon which to base more precise tweaking to achieve the desired result. It selects the type of algorithm used internally by the plug-in, initializes source settings with all-round usage values, amongst other things.\nSelecting the right mode for your material should be the first step you perform before doing any further editing.\n\nPlease note that the algorithms used to process the signal are very different for the three modes, so setting the right mode here is crucial to proper operation, and failing to so would heavily compromise the quality and accuracy of the audible result.\n\nIn some cases however, for example if you’re crafting special effects for sound design, are interested in deliberately emphasizing artifacts or maybe creating distorted robotic voices, well of course, nothing should stop you from trying even the most weird and technically absurd combinations, your imagination and taste is the limit!\n\n\nVoice Mode is specifically targeted at voice processing, be it spoken word or sung material. By default, the Polyphonic option is disabled in this mode, as a monophonic voice (one speaker or singer) is the most common case. If you’re dealing with a choir or harmonized voice, you should enable the polyphonic setting - but not when processing double-tracked vocals.\n\n\n\nInstrument Mode should be used when dealing with any kind of material other than vocals, whether this originates from an acoustic, analog or digital source recording, as long as it originates from an instrument that is playing individual pitched notes. Polyphonic is disabled by default in this mode, and should only be enabled with a true polyphonic recording, such as a guitar or piano playing chords or a melody accompanied by a bass line. A mix of two different instruments, each playing an independent monophonic line, does not fall into this case, as it involves two different timbres, and the Music mode should therefore be used instead.\n\n\n\nMusic Mode should only be used for treating a full mix, that is material consisting of several instruments playing. In this mode, the Polyphonic option is enabled and locked, and processing is restricted to a global transposition, so the plug-in operates as a high-quality pitch-shift unit.\n\n\n\nWhen enabled, the Polyphonic option disables some functions such as the pitch-tracking module. Pitch-tracking and extraction of overlapping notes in a reliable and artifact-free manner is currently extremely difficult to achieve and generally requires advanced user interaction.\nHere monophonic means one-note at a time, and not monaural (single channel). The plug-in itself can naturally process any channel configuration, be it mono, stereo, as well as surround recordings. The mono sum of all input channels is used for the detection.\nSometimes it is not so straightforward to decide wether the source is monophonic or not, as in the case of a complex electronic sound texture, or if a monophonic part is drenched in echo and reverberation, leading to notes that overlap in time a lot. In this case you should also try the Music setting and let your ears decide which is best."

    "text": "The Source Filter is an advanced type of vocoder to morph the spectrum and dynamics of one signal into another.\nThe plugin relies on a source-filter model of sound to gradually combine a source track and a filter track into the output, by gradually mixing their dynamics, i.e. time envelope or signal level contour, and spectrum, i.e. the structure of amplitudes versus frequency.\nThe source-filter model fits the physical description of human voice production quite well, with the source being the vocal cords and the filter the vocal tract. Some instruments fit this rough description too. For example, for the clarinet, the source would be the reed and the filter the instrument cavity. Simple analog synthesizers also use the source-filter paradigm, in form of one or more frequency-controlled oscillators fed to various kinds of low-order filters.\n\nNB: Ch.1 corresponds to the left channel of your DAW track, Ch2 to the right one.\n\n\n\nAdjusts the oversampling factor, set to zero (none) by default.

Theses early reflexions are particularly important as they describe the immediate spatial environment around the sound source: walls, floor, roof. Theses reflexions are depending on the source position : they are panned in the space.\nA second delay generator follows the early stage, called CLUSTER. Theses early reflexions comes a bit later, and have seen their density increased in comparaison to the first early. They can be shown as a transition stage between the early and the late tail generator. In a standard configuration, theses reflexions are seen as a common part of all the space : they are not localized. You can make it directive using the diffuseness parameter.\nA final LATE TAIL stage, synthetize the reverb tail. Most of the time, acoustical description of this tail shows it as an dense and homogeneous material in the reverberated space (you can change that too with the same diffuseness parameter).\n\nUnderstanding this time structure, and the associated listening feeling is really important for an enhanced approach to any reverberation system.\nFor a first quick approach, you can:\n\nset the reverberation time with the main decay time\nset the room basics characteristic with the room size meta-parameter\nset some room filters, to adapt the tail to your current needs."

In more technical terms, this is sometimes referred to as the RT60 factor, which is the time at which the response of the reverberation to an input signal goes below -60dB of attenuation.\nPlease bear in mind that the master decay and high/mid/low controls are interactive, which means that the same audible result can be attained with different settings. This is intentional, as this allows you to get to the result faster and in a manner suited to your personal habits.\nGenerally speaking, it might be more convenient to adjust the master decay time using the resulting sound as a guideline, then fine tune using high and/or low decay controls and leave the mid decay at the default setting. On the other hand, if you specifically to concentrate on the mids, for example to create a ‘hollow room’ sound, it’s easier to focus on the mid decay control, leaving hi and mid decay untouched.\n\n\n\nAdjusts relative decay time of high frequencies specifically. It is expressed as a ratio of the global decay time setting explained above. Default setting is 0.5, meaning the high frequencies decay faster than the main decay time. This behavior is quite typical of natural spaces, where high frequencies are easily absorbed (by furniture, carpet, etc…) before the lowest ones. Roughly speaking, for a given master decay time, increasing this ratio increases the sense of liveliness of the acoustic space, whereas decreasing it deadens it.\nThe correspondingly affected band frequencies are determined by the Crossover freq. high control setting.\n\n\n\nAdjusts relative decay time of medium frequencies specifically. Default setting is 1.\nThe mid range is where the human ear is most sensitive, and roughly corresponds to the frequency spectrum of the human voice. The correspondingly affected band frequencies are comprised in between the Crossover freq. high and low control frequency values .\n\n\n\nAdjusts relative decay time of low frequencies specifically. Default setting is 1.\nIn most real acoustic spaces, low frequencies reverberate freely in the sense that wall materials barely affect the low-frequency response, except if specifically adapted materials have been employed such as bass-traps and anything that acts as a tuned resonator. Generally room size and shape is what influences the low-frequency reverberation content the most, so one could say the default setting corresponds to a space with no low-frequency specific acoustic treatment.\nThe correspondingly affected band frequencies are determined by the Crossover freq. low control setting.\n\n\n\nSets the frequency above which reverberation time is determined by the Decay high setting, expressed in Hertz(Hz).\nDefault value: 5657 Hz\n\n\n\nSets the frequency below which reverberation time is determined by the Decay low setting, expressed in Hertz(Hz).\nDefault value: 177 Hz"

It corresponds to the direct sound, i.e. the direct path from the source to the listener’s ears. This is always the first part of the sound that is heard.\nThe input is fed in parallel to the early reflections generator, abbreviated EARLY. Early reflections play a crucial role in our spatial perception of sound, as they allow us to build a mental representation of the surrounding environment (locations and materials of the walls, fl oor and ceiling). These reflections vary with source position and are panned accordingly.\nThe output of the EARLY stage is fed to a second generator, named CLUSTER, which is responsible for later early reflections. These diff er from early reflections in that they come later and with increased density. This models a transition stage between early and LATE/TAIL generators. In a typical standard configuration, they are a component of the whole acoustic space with no particular localization in order to blend in seamlessly. You can however force them to be directive by changing the diffuseness parameter.\nThe LATE/TAIL stage finally generates the reverberation tail. Acoustical analysis of this component has shown it to consist of dense material, homogeneous with the whole of the reverberated space. As with CLUSTER, the diff useness parameter allows you to override this natural behavior.\n\nA good understanding of this time structure and how it affects perception of sound and space is key to be able to exploit any reverberation system to its full potential and achieve the best sonic results."

    "text": "This is the duration of the reverberation ‘tail’ in seconds, in other words how long it takes for the reverberated sound to vanish away. In more technical terms, this is sometimes referred to as the RT factor, which is the time at which the response of the reverberation to an input signal goes below -60dB of attenuation.\nPlease bear in mind that the master decay and high/mid/low controls are interactive, which means that the same audible result can be attained with different settings. This is intentional, as this allows you to get to the result faster and in a manner suited to your personal habits. Generally speaking, it might be more convenient to adjust the master decay time using the resulting sound as a guideline, then fine tune using high and/or low decay controls and leave the mid decay at the default setting. On the other hand, if you specifically to concentrate on the mids, for example to create a ‘hollow room’ sound, it’s easier to focus on the mid decay control, leaving hi and mid decay untouched.\n\n\n\nThis parameter is a meta parameter that allow you to quickly perform an homogeneous set of parameters for the early reflexions part (early + cluster). Theses part are particularly important to achieve the “room” feeling of the desired space. It adjust the time structure of the whole reverberation (early-min, early-max, cluster-min, cluster-max, reverb-start). This is a key control for quick settings, before a detailed fi ne tune with each parameters.\n\n\n\nPreDelay controls the time at which the reverberation portion of the effect starts to be heard, with respect to the DIRECT signal. Increasing this helps to distinguish between direct and effected sound and preserve intelligibility, especially with large decay times and room sizes which would otherwise drench the audio material in reverberation."

The algorithm is intellectual property of Jünger Audio.\nITU BS.1770-1 Loudness based measurement. Several filters and RMS weighting are used to get a loudness equivalent result. Starting from the well-known A, B, C weighting curves (DIN-IEC 651) the ITU did further research into the relationship of frequencies, their overall levels, their peak levels and the duration of signals, to develop the best representation of human loudness perception.\nITU BS.1770-2 and ITU BS.1770-3 The ITU BS.1770-1 frequency weighted measurement has been extended by a gating function.\n\nThe EBU PLOUD-Group developed a gating function to exclude quiet sections from the measurement to prevent possible loudness under-read. An example is background noise, which does not contribute to the loudness perception as much as louder signals. This gating function consists of an absolute threshold at -70LUFS and a relative threshold 10LU below the absolute gated level.\nThis involves the necessity to recalculate the whole measurement with every subsequent block.\n\nEBU R128 This is a work-to-rule based on ITU BS.1770-3.\n\nTo characterize an audio signal the measurements of Program Loudness, Loudness Range and Maximum True Peak Level are used. The Program Loudness level is normalized to -23LUFS with a permitted deviation of +/- 1LU.\nThe measurement includes a gating method as specified in ITU BS.1770-2/-3 (EBU Tech Doc 3341). Loudness Range (LRA) measures the variation of loudness over the measurement interval. It is supplementary to the measurement of overall (integrated) loudness. Units are LU (EBU Tech Doc 3342). The maximum permitted True Peak Level of a program during production is -1dBTP.\n\nSummary, Available Modes \n\n!> Important note: Systems working in ITU BS.1770-1 mode do not feature a gating function. Thus its output readings may vary from meters compliant to EBU R128 or ITU BS.1770-2/-3. Further keep in mind that the gate is only applicable to the integrated or program loudness measurement and not used for short-term or momentary measurements.\n\n\n\nThe link function connects all the parameters of the processed channels and links the control circuits of the processing blocks in order to maintain the sound balance of these channels.\nTwo link options are available for stereo and surround processing:\n\nStereo Mode: Linked/Unlinked\nSurround Mode (Only affecting the LFE channel): Linked/Unlink LFE\n\n\nStereo Mode - Unlinked\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, the results of the recent loudness measurement cycle, before Reset (8) was pressed, are displayed.\n\nThe recent values are the values displayed in Green to the right of the RT values.\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, the current loudness measurement cycle is paused/resumed.\nThe time markers under Input and Output displays the effective duration of the current measurement cycle; pause periods are not calculated into the effective duration.\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, a new loudness measurement cycle is started and the current one is ended. The current values are stored in Recent Values (6) right before Reset is pressed. Level Magic\n\n\n\nResets only the ‘max-parameters’ (Short-Term Max, Momentary Max, True Peak Max) without ending the loudness measurement cycle.

LKFS and LUFS are different unit names for the same measure, which are fully compatible.\nValue Range: 0 / -50 LKFS/LUFS\n\n\n\nPlease Note - This parameter is only available in the Level mode.\nThe signal is balanced around this operating level to achieve a consistent loudness impression for the listener. In order to preserve the natural dynamics of the program the balancing process does not, as far as it’s possible, affect single peaks.\nValue Range: 0 / -50 dBFS\n\n\n\nThe Leveler Time parameter controls the speed at which LevelMagic(TM) attempts to reach the loudness target. This setting should not be confused with the attack time of a conventional sound processor.\nAs the leveling process is a self-adjusting system the Leveler Time is not an absolute term but rather an initial value that could exceed the numerical value many times. When setting the Time it is necessary to take the overall function of the system into account. Production duties may require faster time settings, while ingest or play-out correction systems may require slower settings.\nValue Range: 10 sec. / 2h\n\n\n\nThe Leveler Max Gain parameter controls the maximum permitted gain change to reach the target level. Limiting the maximum amount of gain can be advantageous in order to minimize the risk of overly boosting noise and other unwanted signals.\nThe maximum attenuation is not affected by this setting. The system regulates the maximum attenuation adaptively to the signal structure.\nValue Range: 0 / +40 dB\n\n\n\nThe Leveler Freeze Level function holds the amount of gain or attenuation if the signal level drops below this threshold.\nIt works in a similar way to a hold function in other sound processors.\nAn example:\n> Assuming the process applies a gain change of 10 dB to achieve target loudness, the input level will suddenly drop below freeze level. The gain change remains in its last state until the signal returns above Freeze Level. This behaviour is different to the Processing Threshold (28) where the gain change would return to its neutral state if the level falls below threshold.\nIt is necessary to always set Freeze Level above the Processing Threshold to prevent unwanted release behaviour.\nValue Range: -20 / -60 dBFS\n\n\n\nThe response of the Transient Processor is a highly self-adjusting process reacting adaptively to the incoming signal structure.\nThe response can be adjusted in three presets from a more vital to a more relaxed setting but is also depending on the Limiter Processing setting. This means that the overall handling of transients and peaks is determined by the parameters of the Transient Processor and the Limiter.\nResponse Presets:\n\nSoft\nMid\nHard\n\n\n\n\nThe Transient Processor can be limited to a maximum processing gain range. Sometimes a hard setting with a very limited gain range can sound more natural than a softer response at full gain range. Adjusting the Transient Processor according to the designated overall behaviour of the LevelMagic(TM) process will improve its neutral processing character.\nValue Range: 0 / +15 dB Level Magic\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, the Limiter processing is enabled.\nValue Range: ON / OFF\n\n\n\nThe limiting process is designed to always deliver an as neutral and well sounding result as possible, and an option to further improve its neutrality is provided by selecting one of the five given presets to match the actual content of the processed audio signal.\nProcessing Profile Presets:\n\nLive Fastest response\nSpeech Fast response\nPop Medium response\nUni Slow response\nClassic Slowest response\n\n\nPlease note that the limiter setting will have an impact on the Transient Processor.\n\n\n\n\nThe Limiter Max True Peak sets the threshold for the system’s true peak limiter. Its fast detection system with a 2ms lookahead time characterizes its response as a full brick wall limiter, not only for the obvious sample peaks but also for the hidden inter-sample peaks.\nValue Range: -20 / 0 dBTP\n\n\n\nWhen pressed, the Expert Mode is enabled.\nInitially LevelMagic(TM) runs as a ‘set-up and forget’ processor delivering supreme leveling results. To improve the result of the process even further, the option to adjust a range of ‘internal’ parameters is provided. Once these parameters are set they remain active even if the Expert Mode is disabled.\nValue Range: ON / OFF\n\n\n\nAll gain changes are processed adaptively to the incoming audio signal. Under normal conditions this adaptive reaction is completely sufficient. Though, in certain configurations it may be necessary to have a faster recovery or release time.\nAn example: > If LevelMagic(TM) is configured to work without gain or with just a very small amount of positive gain, then returning to unity from heavy attenuation can take quite some time. If a very loud part (above target) is followed by a quiet section (right at or below target), the recovery from damping will lead to an unnatural fade-in effect for the quiet section. In order to decrease this effect and accelerate the fade-in time, AGC Recovery can be set to [Fast] and will then be >accelerated up to fifteen times its normal speed.\nThe result sounds almost similar to if an audio engineer rides the fader to correct unwanted level jumps and thus becomes very natural and well accepted by the listener. This setting is most helpful for setups where no positive gain (AGC amplification) is allowed. The effect works relative to the Leveler Time setting and hence is more obvious for short Leveler Time values.\nValue Range: Normal / Fast\n\n\n\nThis is a triggered action that resets the dynamic processing without any release time. Imagine a short circuit to the timing circuits of an analog dynamic processor, which discharges the whole system and immediately returns the dynamic gain to its neutral state.\nThis function is useful to reset the process when switching programs (e.g. from movie to commercial breaks).\n\n\n\nThis parameter directly depends on the Clear History trigger.\nInstead of resetting the dynamic gain, it can be preloaded to a desired value the moment Clear History is triggered. The preload value is specified by the Initial Dynamic Gain parameter. This helps to reduce attack time artifacts if switching programs incorporates a known and undesired level jump. It is not necessary to exactly predict the level difference between the programs but already helpful to set up a few dB in the right direction.\nAn example: > The level jump from a movie to a commercial break is usually around 6dB. Resetting LevelMagic(TM) at the transition point helps to even-out the difference. Still, the process needs some attack time to build up a damping of 6dB, which can be audible depending on the program structure. If the gain is reset to a damping value between -4 to -6dB instead, the attack time is much shorter and artifacts will fall below the perception threshold. In many cases an Initial Dynamic Gain value of +/-3 dB is sufficient to create transitions with seamless loudness.\nValue Range: -40 / +15 dB\n\n\n\nThe Low Level Behaviour parameters define what happens if the level drops below the Processing Threshold.\nIn continuous operation the Below Threshold mode should remain in [Release]. In this case the dynamic gain slowly returns to its neutral state in case of signal absence, and a returning signal would start a new processing period with its lead-in attack time. This may not be desired, especially in production applications where transport operations introduce unnatural gaps. In those cases setting the Below Threshold mode to [Hold] will pause the dynamic processing at the last value until the signal returns. Returning signals are treated just like continuous signals.\nThis function has some similarities to the Freeze Level but works with a different designation as it is meant to keep processing fluent over signal loss.\nValue Range: Release / Hold\n\n\n\nThis parameter sets the threshold for when to activate the processing.\nValue Range: -20 / -80 dBFS\nDefault Value: -70 dBFS"

Here we present a way of taking control of the LevelMagic(TM) plug-in using this protocol.\n\n\n\nIf your control device uses bonjour or Zero conf protocol configuration will be quick and simple. Just select Flux::OSC in the ZeroConf device of your controller. Then, write the output port and IP address of your device in the labels of the plug-in. Remember that in the output port label of the plug-in you should write the input port of your controller and in the output address of the plug-in you should write the IP address of your device.\n\n\n\nThe following parameters are used to configure OSC manually in LevelMagic(TM)\n\nNetwork configuration: OSC is a network based protocol so make sure that both your controller and the host are connected to the same network.\nOSC Enable: When turned on this parameter creates a thread for receiving and sending OSC messages. This thread is multi-instances. This means that this will control all the instances of the plug-in. For example, if you have four LevelMagic(TM) opened, all the communication and control via OSC will be done via this one configured thread. You just have to be sure that the following parameters are well configured.\nInput Port: This is the port where the plug-in will be receiving OSC messages (the output of your control surface)\nOutput Port: This is the port where the plug-in will send feedback to (the input of your control surface).\nOutput IP Address: This is the address of destination of the outgoing OSC packets of the plug-in. You should write here the IP address of your controller\n\nThe image below presents the different OSC parameters used for configuration.\n\n\n\n\nThe Flux:: OSC manager will send feedback to your controller. These are the different situations when you will receive feedback:\n\nWhen a parameter begins to be edited\nIn this situation, the plug-in will send the following OSC messages:\n\nAddress Pattern: /NumberOfInstance/ControlBeginEdit\n\nArgument: Name of the parameter.\n\nType: String\n\nWhen the edition of a parameter ends\n\nAddress Pattern: /NumberOfInstance/ControlEndEdit\nArgument: Name Of the parameter\nType: String\n\nWhen a value is changed\nWhen a parameter is changed in the plug-in by any mean (OSC, mouse, automation or other… ) Flux :: Osc will send a message with the new value of the parameter and the instance number of the plug-in it belongs to.\n\nAddress Pattern: /NumberOfInstance/ParameterName\nArgument: Float from 0 to 1, represents the value of the parameter.\nType: Float\n\nWhen creating a new instance\nWhen a new instance of a plug-in is created Flux:: OSC will send the following message:\n\nAddress Pattern: /NewInstanceRegisteredWithNumber\nArgument: The number assigned to the new instance created.\nType: Float\n\nWhen an instance of a plug-in is destroyed\n\nAddress Pattern: /InstanceUnregisteredWithNumber\nArgument: Represents the index of the instance that was destroyed.\nType: Float,\n\n\n\n\n\nFlux :: OSC gives you the possibility to use multiple controllers for one instance of a plug-in and have a particular feedback for each one. If you want to use multiple controllers refer to the use of the /TalkToMeOnPort Command found under “Commands”.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first you have to know what an OSC message is composed of. Mainly, these two parts: The Address Pattern and the Argument.\nFor controlling parameters Flux:: only supports arguments of float type so make sure that the arguments you are sending via your controller are Floats. Float arguments must always be from 0 to 1 for controlling a parameter so you don’t have to deal with scale conversion.\n\n\n\nWhen OSC is enabled in the Plug-in Settings (2) the file “OSC_Dict.xml” is automatically created in:\n/Documents/Flux/LevelMagic\nThis is a properties dictionary with each parameter that can be controlled and mapped using OSC. The commands in the dictionary includes a ”Translation” attribute that can be used in order translate the OSC name into the Flux:: internal parameter name in both directions.\n\n\n\nGlobal commands allow you to access to some additional information. These commands don’t need an instance number. These are the available additional commands: - Address Pattern:/GetDeviceInfo - Type: Float - Value: 1 - Explanation: Get all the names of the controllable parameters\n\nAddress Pattern: /TalkToMeOnPort\nType: Float\nValue: Port Number\nExplanation: This command is very strong. It will store the IP address and the port in argument as an endpoint. All the different messages will be sent to this endpoint. This command is very useful for using many controllers.\nAddress Pattern: /GetCurrentValues\nType: Float\nValue: 1\nExplanation: This command will send all the current values of the different instances of a plug-in. The structure of the sent OSC messages is the same as the one for controlling them.\nAddress Pattern: /GetNumberOfInstances\nType: Float\nValue: 1\nExplanation: This command returns the opened number of instances of a plug-in. If you have five LevelMagic(TM) opened this command will return 5."

Pure Compressor produces a wide range of compressions from ultra clean subtle compressions to classic heavy pumping ones - It’s all up to your artistic choices, not to the technology limitations.\nThe Threshold value is expressed in dB - The plug-in compares it to the RMS (Root Mean Square or effective power) of the input signal. This value is displayed as a green rectangle on the input level meter.\nThe level variations above the threshold are affected by the Ratio value.\nFor a 1:1 compression ratio, the processed signal isn’t affected by the processing: A 1 dB variation above the threshold at the input is reflected by a 1 dB variation at the output. Try applying a 3:1 ratio, if the input signal rises above 3 dB the threshold value, the output signal rises only from 1 dB: Here is the compressor action. The input signal gain is reduced by a 3:1 ratio above the threshold point.\nThe Knee sets how progressive is the start up of the compressor action – In other words, It smoothes the transition point between no processing and full processing. If the Knee value expressed in dB is increased, the progressiveness of the action will be spread below and above the threshold point.\nThe Range value sets the processing maximum action.

To start understanding this setting and easily hear it, take a full mixed drum kit or a complete mix with punchy drums, set the compression threshold, ratio to get something near pumping or an aggressive compression.\nThen increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and then toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less compression impression; especially in terms of attack.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the behavior of the Dynamic Ratio is inverted. The ratio value is increased depending of the detected signal dynamic.\n\n\n\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 0 / 100\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 0 %\nAllows process the audio signal independently of the sound level but regarding the signal dynamic range. It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound ™pumping∫ when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etcº ) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D..

Pure DCompressor allows you to restore the original dynamic of a sound. It‘s very useful for heavily compressed signal. Pure DCompressor adds some naturalness.\nThe Threshold value is expressed in dB – The plug-in compares it to the RMS (Root Mean Square or effective power) of the input signal. This value is displayed as a green rectangle on the input level meter. The level variations above the threshold are affected by the Ratio value. For a 1:1 de-compressor ratio, the processed signal isn’t affected by the processing: A 1 dB variation above the threshold at the input is reflected by a 1 dB variation at the output. Let’s apply now a 3:1 ratio. If the input signal rises above 1 dB the threshold value, the output signal rises from 3 dB: Here is the de-compressor action. The input signal gain is increased by a 3:1 ratio above the threshold point.\nThe Knee sets how progressive is the start up of the compressor action – In other words, It smoothes the transition point between no processing and full processing. If the Knee value expressed in dB is increased, the progressiveness of the action will be spread below and above the threshold point. The Range value sets the processing maximum action. No gain variation can exceed this value."

To start understanding this setting and easily hear it, take a full mixed drum kit or a complete mix with punchy drums, set the compression threshold, ratio to get something near pumping or an aggressive compression.\nThen increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and then toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less compression impression; especially in terms of attack.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the behavior of the Dynamic Ratio is inverted.

Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound “pumping” when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etc…) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect.

Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound “pumping” when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etc…) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumping… In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients.\n\n\n\n\nSets the gain range of the L.I.D. parameter.\n\nUp: Increasing of the L.I.D. action\nDown: Decreasing of the L.I.D. action The current L.I.D.

For Expander and DExpander sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) stays inside the area between the two blue lines.\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the threshold for the processing is determined by the maximum values from RMS/peak detection OR from the signal dynamic detection.

    "text": "Pure Expander\nProduct Page | Shop Page\n\n\nPure Expander is the expander section of the Solera. An expander is used to automatically reduce the gain below the Threshold. The exclusive Dynamic Ratio algorithm developed by Flux:: allows you to remove unwanted noises or reverberation without adding a processed character to your sound. Pure Expander produces a wide range of expansion process from subtle expansions to hard noise-gate.\nThe Threshold value is expressed in dB - The plug-in compares it to the RMS (Root Mean Square or effective power) of the input signal. This value is displayed as a green rectangle on the input level meter. The level variations below the threshold are affected by the Ratio value. For a 1:1 expansion ratio, the processed signal isn’t affected by the processing: A 1 dB variation below the threshold at the input is reflected by a 1 dB variation at the output.\nTry applying a 1:3 ratio, if the input signal falls below 1 dB the threshold value, the output signal falls from 3 dB: Here is the expander action. The input signal gain is reduced by a 3:1 ratio below the threshold point.\nThe Knee sets how progressive is the start up of the compressor action – In other words, It smoothes the transition point between no processing and full processing. If the Knee value expressed in dB is increased, the progressiveness of the action will be spread below and above the threshold point.\nThe Range value sets the processing maximum action. No gain variation can exceed this value."

    "text": "Product Page | Shop Page\nThe Solera dynamic processor is a comprehensive dynamic processor providing a compressor, expander, de-compressor and de-expander, that each may be enabled individually, all processing in parallel using one single common detector.\nEach of the dynamics sections employs independent Dynamic Ratio and L.I.D. (Level Independent Detector) settings, two parameters that are kind of unique to dynamic processing, using the dynamic range content of the signal and not just the signal levels as standard dynamics processors do.\nDynamic Ratio (23) is controlling the amount of auto-ratio determined by the signal dynamics and the manual ratio setting.\nL.I.D. (25) (Level Independent Detector) controls the amount of auto-threshold determined by the signal dynamics and the manual threshold value, providing processing of the audio signal independently of the sound level and instead in regards to the signal dynamic range.\n\n\nFor full visual control over the processing Solera provides a comprehensive display area including:\n\nResultant dynamics curve\nParametric curve for the side-chain EQ\nInput level (VU-Meter referenced to -16 dB FS by default)\nOutput level\nResultant envelope (Compression, De-Compression, Expansion, De-Expansion & Clipper activity)\nDynamic difference between input and output\nLevel difference between input and output\n\n\n\n\nTo conform with the demands of serious audio mastering Solera features a Mid/Side (MS) encoder/decoder section encoding the signal from the stereo inputs by summing left and right channels to produce the Mid, and by phase switching the right channel from the left channel to produce the Side signal.\nProcessing M and S as separate components with a compressor makes it possible to achieve results that would be impossible with a regular stereo setup.\nExample:\nA bass drum in the stereo center with a fluctuating level surrounded by a synthesizer pad. The M channel featuring the bass drum can be processed without affecting the S channel featuring the Synthesizer pad. Changing the S gain when decoding allows controlling the stereo width using MS Width (20).\nThe Solera MS mode should only be used with stereo signal and it is strongly recommended to avoid this on already MS encoded signal.\n\n\n\nSolera features a three band Detector Equalizer for frequency-sensitive processing. The Detector EQ does not affect the direct audio signal, but instead it applies to the signal detection channel that drives the processing, offering the option to shape the actual processing to be performed within a certain frequency range. For further control of the processing, optional external side-chain signal feeding is provided.\nEven though the Detector EQ parameters value ranges may seem extreme, with a Q-Factor up to 10, frequencies above 20 KHz and with cumulative gain, really smooth results can be achieved without deteriorating artefacts even when dealing with frequencies out of the audio spectrum. The purpose with this is to be able to use a part of the correction and include it into the audio spectrum; this is one of the secrets behind the “Air” correction often featured on vintage audio processors.\nThe wide range processing ensures a perfect accuracy in terms of phase and propagation time. Filtering the control signal upstream of the envelope gain generation allows for controlling the overall tonal balance by increasing or decreasing the processing of a particular part of the audio spectrum.\nReducing the gain for the low frequencies before the detection, increase the low frequencies in the processed signal if the processing settings reduce the gain according to the signal level. With this configuration, increasing the gain for the high frequencies makes the processing more sensitive to this particular part of the audio spectrum, and turns Solera into a sibilance controller.\n\n\n\nA delay line can be inserted into the processed signal with the main purpose to produce a zero/null attack time for the processing when the delay value equals the Attack time. The Auto (46) button automatically sets the delay value according to the Attack time. Setting the delay time lower than the Attack time preserves the peaks from the processing.\n\n\n\nThe original dry signal can be mixed with the processed material using the Dry Mix (2) dial. The original audio peaks are kept and added to the processed sound to preserve the sensitive information of the sound attacks. > Note that the Dry Mix function takes the delay that may be introduced by the processing into account. The summing is done before the clipper stage, and the displayed gain also reflects the Dry Mix setting."

Then increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less of the compression impression, especially the attack.\n\n\n\n\nWhen engaged, the behaviour of the Dynamic Ratio is inverted.\nThe ratio value is increased depending of the detected signal dynamics.\n\n\n\nControls the amount of auto-threshold determined by the signal dynamics and the manual threshold value, providing processing of the audio signal independently of the sound level and instead in regards to the signal dynamic range.\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 0 / 100\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 0 %\n\nUse a full song mix. Set the ratio to 3-4 for the compression to start working and the threshold of the compressor to the max value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Now increase the L.I.D. and you will hear the compression working again. Next decrease or increase the input gain, the compression will continue to work equally completely independent of the sound level, only depending on Ratio, Knee and sound content.\nWhen you have too much dynamic in the sound, going from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB, and you want to compress the low levels, you will get a pumping effect when the sound reaches the high levels. The only thing to do with a standard compressor is to increase the threshold to retain the airiness in the sound. But when this is done the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear differences (in term density, live space, grain etc.) especially when the compressor starts working.\nWith Solera, adjust the threshold and ratio on the high levels to what you find okay, then increase the L.I.D. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen to the low levels and especially the transition between low and high levels. You can also increase the ratio for a stronger effect, and you will notice that the compression will still be present and still affect the high/loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D.) and make the compression very smooth with no more pumping.

And then you can enable the clipper to increase the Output Gain and make your sound louder.\n\n\nAs Thickness is completely level independent, and since it’s not adding any compression, you can add a lot off thickness and still fine tune the amount of compression by doing the following:\n\nSet Amount and Thickness to 100 %\nEnable the gain Link control\nNow start decreasing the Input Gain\n\nNow you will see and hear the Thickness acting, but the compression will decrease. Now try it again, but make sure to adjust all the other parameters to get the kind of processing you want first.\nAnother little trick, is to decrease the Amount up to round about 50 %, this will be particularly interesting when in “Dynamic Deep” Mode.\n\n\n\nNow you should have a basic understanding of how the processing works, but never forget that Syrah tries to adapt to material you are processing and the result can be astonishingly different for a voice than for a bass or for drums, or a keyboard, guitar etc. and of course, for a complete mix…"

Default setting is off, and in this state, the attack depends on the Speed parameter value.\nTurning on the Lookahead will introduce some delay in the processing (not in the detection though).\n\n\n\nThis is one of the most significant controls on Syrah, and is defining how the algorithm automatically tries to adapt the processing to the audio material.\n\n\nBy selecting one of the two provided dynamic modes, there’s a range of parameters that becomes dynamic, these parameters will vary in sync according to the audio analysis, and the algorithm will attempt to process aiming at a result that feels closer to the original material, more natural (unless you are over-processing to achieve a more effectfull processing).\n\nDynamic Soft (Default)\nIn Soft mode, the release becomes automatic (according to the “Velocity” setting) so does the compression, de-expansion, the clipper knee and the “Relax” value.\nThis setting is suitable when a more natural kind of sound is desired, such as track compression, bus mix and final mix.\nDynamic Deep\nDynamic Deep is similar to Dynamic Soft, but with a deeper, stronger compression providing a higher range of effect.\nThis mode invites to a much more “creative” use of Syrah, and is very suitable for track compression.\nStatic\nAs opposed to the dynamic modes, the Static Mode provides a more manual processing with less dynamic influences and manual release (according to the Velocity).\nThis mode is more a traditional kind of dynamic processing, well suited for both track compression and final\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControls the processing integration time and the attack time when Lookahead is not enabled.\nUnit: Percent (%)\nRange: 0.00 to 100.\nMin.

Steps: 0.\nDefault Value: 50.\n\n\n\nMultiplies the release range by three, allowing for very slow release times.\n\n\n\nBy using logarithmic calculations (instead of linear) when defining the release time, a faster reaction time, resulting in a deeper compression impression, is achieved.\n\n\n\nLinks the detection over all the processed channels.\nNot available when M/S Mode is enabled as the Mid and Side is then processed individually.\n\n\n\nIncreases the entire processing intensity; more compression, more de-expansion, more dynamic influence (when using the dynamic “Mode” settings), straightforwardly described – More of everything!\n\n\n\nInverts the final gain envelope proposing particularly effect-full processing such as hashing the sound, auto-gating or ambience/reverb reduction.\nThe inverse parameter is allowing for some really creative tweaking, entirely changing the ongoing processing, and transforming Syrah in a “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” kind of way. If no “Amount” is defined, it’s perfectly normal if there’s no sound at all coming from the Output!\n\n\n\nThe Mid/Side mode is only available when processing stereo material.\nWhen enabling the M/S Mode, the material is M/S encoded for individual processing, and then decoded back to stereo again just before the Dry Mix stage.\nThis is a well known technique often used in mastering allowing to increase or decrease the stereo image, keep or fall down center impact like kick, snare and similar.\nAn interesting feature with this mode, is that since Syrah analyzes the audio material to adapt the processing, the result will generally match the standard stereo material better, allowing for a bigger range of possible sound modification: dynamically increasing the space (room) impression, boost the main center components and similar tasks.\nLink Channel function will not be available in this mode and “Relax Bass” function will only be applied on the M (Mid) component of the material.\n\n\n\nOnly available when in “M/S Mode”\nSince the M/S processing can dramatically change the stereo image (as in possibly making it too wide..), MS Width provides control over the actual stereo width.\nThis setting can be effective when there’s a need for enhancing the stereo image width, increasing the room impression and similar tasks.\n\n\n\nFattens up the processed material by enhancing the low level frequencies when possible. The processing action will then go from de-expansion to compression (instead of compression only).\nThis parameter works completely sound level independent.\n\n\n\nDefines a certain amount of auto ratio according to the audio material, “relaxing” the compression when working with high dynamics and generates a kind of smooth and dynamic attack. Relax also affects the release by modifying how the dynamic detection will react in time.\n\n\n\nControls the amount of low-shelve frequencies inserted into the side chain. The more you increase the value, the less the compression will react to low frequency content allowing for more low frequencies to pass through the processing.\nIn M/S Mode this will only be applied to the M (Mid) component of the material.\n\n\n\nControls the amount (compression, de-expansion) and the solidity of the processing."

When clicking on one of the preset slots (38), the built in preset manager appears.\nThe preset manager contains three preset banks, the Factory bank contains factory presets, this bank is not available for saving of presets but any of the presets can be loaded into a preset slot and then saved into, the User bank, where all user presets are saved. Finally, the Global bank, which is a bit special, here you can save a complete snapshot with all the settings from both preset slots, as well as the position of the morphing slider.\nIn the preset manager, any preset can be loaded into a preset slot by double clicking on the name of the desired preset in the actual preset list, the preset will then be loaded into the preset slot corresponding to the position of the morphing slider.\n\n\n\nRecall A loads the selected preset into the corresponding slot.\nRecall B loads the selected preset into the corresponding slot.\nUpdate, saves the current settings into the selected preset.\nNew, saves the current settings into a new preset.\nDuplicate creates a copy of the selected preset and saves it to the list.\nEdit allows for changes to the preset meta properties.\nDelete, removes the selected preset.\nExport, creates a file reflecting the content of the current preset bank.\nImport, allows for import of a preset bank file by adding the imported banks content to the content in the current preset bank.\n\nWhen saving or editing a preset, an option to protect the preset is presented. The preset protection, if engaged, only allows the original preset author to uncheck and edit the preset. This means that you can protect your presets in a multi-user configuration. Protected presets can only be modified using the session used for their creation. If used in another user session they can only be imported or deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo save a new preset using the built in preset manager, simply click Save in the corresponding preset slot (A/B), and to save changes to your preset, simply click Save again.\nIf you want to resave your preset under a new name, open the preset manager by clicking the corresponding (A/B) preset slot (38), select New, enter a name for your preset, and press Save.\n\n\n\nRecalls the settings of the corresponding slot.\n\n\n\nTo copy all parameters between the preset slots (A to B or B to A), press the Copy A or Copy B button, and the parameters from the corresponding preset slot will be copied into the current preset slot. When copying parameters from one slot to another, the preset morph slider will automatically slide to the slot the parameters where copied to.\n\n\n\nThe morphing slider provides mixing between the settings of slot A and B and allows for some very creative tweaking.\nThe result of the morphing can be saved as a global preset containing the actual settings of both preset slots as well as the morphing slider position.\nTo save a Global preset, open the preset manager by clicking the corresponding (A/B) preset slot (38), then click Global, select New and enter a name for your global preset, then press Save.\n\n\n\nWhen enabling the Automation control button, the morphing slider will be exposed and available for both automation read and write.\nThough with the button engaged, only the morphing slider value is applied when reading automation.\nThe Automation control button must be engaged if the morphing slider needs to be mapped on a control surface.\n\n\n\nDisplays the name of the current preset.\n\n\n\nBy pressing the little arrows in the preset slot, the built in preset manager appears"

It relies on proven technology to model the various phenomena that occur when playing back audio material through a loudspeaker system.\nThis allows monitoring a full surround mix in situations when a surround-capable environment is not available or practical. Another typical use of HEar is doing precise checking of a mix, which is convenient with headphones as these provide a ‘surgical’ and very detailed, microscope-like rendering of the audio.\nIt can also prove very useful in a project studio context, and whenever noise isolation is a concern, as it helps achieving a more realistic sound environment."

    "text": "Our perception of sound mainly relies on our ability to identify and characterize a number of sound sources, depending on the spatial parameters of these sources, such as apparent position and size.\nThe duplex localization theory developed by Lord Rayleigh in 1907, claims two factors are predominant to characterize perception, namely the differences in arrival time (ITD) and intensity (ILD) between sounds reaching our ears. Perceived sound variations between ears are mainly attributed to the head obstructing sound waves and therefore forcing them to travel around the head in order to reach the opposite-facing ear.\nSubsequent studies have confirmed and refined this theory which has prevailed ever since its introduction more than a century ago.\n\n\n\nThe ITD and ILD localization indexes are derived from measurements of the transfer function between the sound source’s origin, taken at a certain incidence, and the listener’s eardrums. The transfer function summarize the transformations the sound goes through before reaching the listener, including diffraction, diffusion and reflection on the listener’s body and head.\nThese measurements are commonly referred to as HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function).\n\n\n\nBinaural technology encompasses methods for recording, processing, synthesizing and reproducing sound that are specifically designed to preserve tridimensional localisation properties.\nIn order to mimic the impression of a sound originating from a given incidence, it is sufficient to filter a mono signal, which on its own lacks any kind of spatial information, with both left and right HRTF filters. This constitutes the foundation of binaural synthesis.\n> Please note that the resulting signal is only meant to be listened to with headphones, and isn’t designed for a conventional stereo loudspeaker setup.\n\n\n\nThis plugin relies on HRTF filter measurements made using a KEMAR (Knowles Electronics Manikin For Acoustic Research) dummy head and torso simulation. This type of manikin was conceived during the 1970’s for conducting acoustics experiments using a model with anthropometric dimensions equivalent to that of an average human listener.\n\nCourtesy of G.R.A.S. Sound & Vibration\nhttp://www.gras.dk/\n\n\n\nThe audio input is routed internally to virtual speakers, through a routing matrix. These represent the emulated loudpseaker setup configuration."

    "text": "The routing matrix gives an overview of the mapping between the plugin’s inputs from the DAW track to the virtual speaker internal outputs. The virtual speaker outputs are down-mixed to stereo using a virtual speaker processing algorithm.\nPlease take note that the plugin’s output to the DAW track itself is always stereo as the binaural processing is intended exclusively for use with headphones.\nThe meters above the fi rst row indicate the source levels of individual input channels.\n\nUser controls\n\n\n\nSpecifies which virtual speaker configuration should be emulated. Available modes depend on the configuration of the track the plugin is inserted into, and comprise of one or more of the following:\n\n5.0\n5.1\n7.1\n8.0\n\n\n\n\nSelects between different spaces with subtly different colorations (Preset 1..3) or completely neutral (No Effect)\n\n\n\nControls the width between virtual speakers, expressed in degrees. The default is 60°, which corresponds to the recommended setting. This allows to narrow or broaden the stereo image.\n\n\n\nControls the angle between the listener and the centre of the virtual speakers. The default is 0°, which corresponds to the ideal listener position, giving a balanced image between channels.\n\n\n\nAdvanced settings to override default behavior, typically when using hosts that do not conform to the standards.\n\n\nOverride automatic track I/O specifications. HEar automatically adjusts its I/O configuration based on what the hosts reports to the plugin. Some hosts such as Logic do not report this correctly or do not support asymmetric I/O configurations In this case you have to do this manually and select amongst a number of choices of symmetric (N-to-N) and asymmetric I/O (N to stereo).\n\n\n\nThese are best left at their default in most cases, but can be changed if required:\n\nDisable processing during bypass: stops processing completely during bypass. Allows to conserve CPU when using many instances and a lot of bypass on/off automation, such as film or sound effects mixing. Default is off (enabled).\nUse Multi-Thread Automation: dedicate a separate thread for automation. Useful when heavy automation is present in the project to get rid of possible audio dropouts. Default is off (processing and automation share the same thread).\nTry to avoid latency as possible: minimize latency by employing minimal buffering, possibly at the expense of a little CPU overhead. Default is on.\nReport latency: report plugin latency, if any, to the host. Some hosts have difficulty coping with large latency values, in this case you can force the plugin to report zero, but you’ll have to manually compensate for this for tracks to remain synced. Default is on (report true latency)."
