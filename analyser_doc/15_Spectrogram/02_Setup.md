setup

## Direction
![](../include/SpectrogramSetupDirection.png)

Define the scrolling direction of the spectrogram.

## Log Gain
Toggles logarithmic scaling of the magnitude spectrum on and off.

Default is on.

When enabled, the magnitude at a time-frequency is applied a logarithmic scaling before being
converted to a pixel value. This has the effect of compressing the dynamic range, and makes low
energy components stand out more, but also decreases the contrast of the display.

## Threshold
### Threshold min

Sets the minimum amplitude spectrum value to be displayed.

### Threshold max

Sets the maximum amplitude spectrum value to be displayed.

## Color Mode

![](../include/SpectrogramColorMode.png)

### Duotone
In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to
a pixel using a two-color palette, set using start/end colors.

### Black On White
In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a Black &amp;
White color palette with White as background.

### White On Black

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a Black &amp;
White color palette with Black as background.
### Power grading 1, 2, 3
In this color
mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using different predefined color palette.

### Frequency grading
In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency
point determines the intensity of the corresponding pixel, whose color varies according to frequency.

### Duotone start/end colors
Sets the color to use for minimum and maximum amplitude components respectively, when color mode is set to 'Duotone'.
