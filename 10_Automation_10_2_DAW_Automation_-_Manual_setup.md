# 10.2 DAW Automation - Manual setup

When you are not using the local audio path workflow, and instead working directly with a connected hardware interface, then you must setup automation manually.

The first step is to go to the _Spat Preferences_ and _Enable OSC_

You then need to set up an OSC port and host route, in order to connect with Spat
plug-ins via OSC. The port and host should match that of the Spat plug-ins. If you
are running Spat and the DAW software on the same machine, then the IP address
is always the so called _LocalHost_ (127.0.0.1) - the port must be the same as in the
Spat Plug-ins. Remember that the index number of each Spat plug in links it to a
virtual source with the same index - or in the case of a Spat Room plugin - it is used
to identify which Room you wish to control



!> Some systems require you to press TAB key and not ENTER after
editing a field in the Plug-in

in the DAW but different and unique Index numbers
