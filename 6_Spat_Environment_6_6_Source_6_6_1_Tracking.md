# 6.6.1 Tracking

Spat Revolution is able to receive data from RTTrPM open protocol tracking systems. Currently, BlackTrax™ is supported natively. BlackTrax™ is a vision-based system that connects to different third party applications, such as robotic lights, media
servers and Spat Revolution.

When you have correctly setup the BlackTrax protocol (see Appendix A) then you
can directly assign Tracking Index to virtual sources, and also to listener position
(see section 5.4) for advanced virtual reality interactive audio projects.
