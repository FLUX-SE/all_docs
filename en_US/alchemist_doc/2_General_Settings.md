## Clipper Ceiling (7)

## Bypass (8)

## Channel Processing Selector (9)

When operating on a multi-channel (surround) bus, all channels are processed by default, but it can be useful to
remove some channels from the processing for some reasons. This selector allows to keep the unchecked channels
untouched. This feature may be used if different settings are required. Several instancies of a plug-in can be used
in series, each one processing a particular channel with its own settings.


## Channel Side Chain Routing (10)

When operating on a multi-channel bus, all channels are feeding the side chain by default, but it can be useful to
prevent some channels feeding the side chain for some reasons.


## Band Selector (11)

The frequency band selection is done here.  
It can also be done from the main display area.


## Number of Band Control (12)

The Minus and Plus buttons allow to specify the number of frequency bands of the Alchemist from 1 to 5.


## Reset Solo (13)

This button disables all engaged band solo.
