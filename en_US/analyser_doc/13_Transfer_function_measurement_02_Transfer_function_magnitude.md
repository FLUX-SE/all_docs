# Transfer function magnitude
The transfer function magnitude displays the gain versus frequency curve of the system under test. 
A pass-through obviously results in a flat horizontal line centered on 0dB. 
This line represents the ideal curve one would be able to achieve if all the systems defects could be compensated for, and that serves as a reference target when doing room correction.
