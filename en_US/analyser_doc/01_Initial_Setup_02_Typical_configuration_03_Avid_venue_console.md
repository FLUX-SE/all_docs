# Avid Venue Console
SampleGrabber is available as a AAX DSP plugin, which is the preferred format when using an AVID
Venue live console. Using one or more SampleGrabber instances will free up several precious hardware
outputs.

When performing transfer function and impulse response measurements, a recommended way of working is
to insert a SampleGrabber on the master output and set the microphone signal as key input. This
simplifies the routing and allows for fast switching between different microphones.
