# Password
An optional password, which is a simple 4 digit number, allows you to apply light encryption to the audio stream for secure transmission over the network. It is set to 0 by default which disables encryption; in this case no additional action in the Pure Analyzer application is required on your part.

If you wish to employ and define a password in SampleGrabber, please enter a matching value in the SampleGrabber menu of the Pure Analyzer application in order to be able to decrypt the incoming stream.

Please note that the security level provided by this encryption is mild, and is only intended to protect from anyone eavesdropping your audio stream inside the internal network. It is not intended as a substitute for conventional network security practices and measures such as software and hardware firewalling, etc.
