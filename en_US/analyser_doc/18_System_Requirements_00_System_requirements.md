# System requirements
Pure Analyzer is built around Flux::SE's new 2D/3D efficient graphic engine, which employs full GPU-acceleration using an OpenGL-compliant graphics card.

In order to experience the outstanding responsiveness with Pure Analyzer, even with a very busy display, and to fully take advantage of the software's analysis capabilities, using a modern nVidia or ATI Radeon
graphics card is recommended.

Older, and other less efficient graphics cards do not have the required performance and specifications, and offload too much work to the CPU (see below).

The processor is also an important factor, and we recommend using at least and Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i5 or newer architecture processor. 
AMD processors are also supported, but might exhibit lower performance, as they do not offer the same capabilities and optimizations as Intel CPUs.

## Minimum requirements

* CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo.
* GPU: OpenGL 2.0 or superior compatible, with pixel-shader support.

## Recommended configuration
CPU: Intel Core i5 or better.

GPU: AMD/ATI Radeon or nVidia video-card. Intel integrated graphics are not powerful enough and should be avoided.

## Common requirements
A free USB port to connect the Flux:: or iLok dongle.

> Please check the latest version of vendor-provided, optimized drivers are installed for your graphics card. Generic drivers are generally less up-to-date and may contain bugs or miss optimizations present in drivers specific to your particular model.
