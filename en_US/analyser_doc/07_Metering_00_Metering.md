# Metering
All meters display the current signal meter values as solid vertical bars, and the peaks are indicated with horizontal lines at the corresponding value. 
Peak hold time can be adjusted in the settings if necessary. 
The peak value is also displayed in a numeric format at the top of the meter, which is emphasized in red in case of clipping or overload.

Several meter displays are available, each scrupulously implementing one of the more common and up-to-date industry norms, as detailed in the following paragraphs.
