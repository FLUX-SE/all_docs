## Release
Release speed of the meter in decibels per second.

## Peak release
Release speed of the peaks in decibel per second.

## Peak hold
Number of frames to hold the peaks, before the actual release phase begins. 
60 frames corresponds to 1 second on a fast system, capable of a 60Hz refresh rate.

## Infinite hold
When enabled, peaks are held until the next reset, which is useful for checking a whole track never clips.

## Reset
