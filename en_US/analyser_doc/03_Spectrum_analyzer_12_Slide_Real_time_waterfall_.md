# Slide (Real Time waterfall)
![](include/SpectrumSlide.png)

# Enable
Enable/disable the slide mode.

# Direction
Define the sliding Direction. From -5 to 5.

Default is 0.

# Fading
Controls display persistence, <i>i.e.</i> the "fade to black" amount for a frame. Lowering this value retains past particles longer, whereas increasing this make them disappear faster.

# Blur
Enable / Disable sliding blur.

# Blur Kernel Size

Controls the radius of the blur effect applied to past particles. Particles are "smeared" more and more as they become older, depending on this setting. Naturally, a bigger value increases the smearing, at the expense of processing power.

> Choosing the value for this setting is really matter of taste, although please keep in mind values that above 5 will require a sufficiently powerful graphics card in order  to maintain a responsive display.
