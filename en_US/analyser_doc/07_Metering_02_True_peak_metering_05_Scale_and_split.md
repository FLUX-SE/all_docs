#Scale &amp; split

## Scale
Meter labels are defined here as a comma separated list of dB values to be shown on the side of the meters. 
This also defines where to the corresponding horizontal markings. 
Default is -72;-40;-18;-9;-6;-3;-1;0;1;3.

## Colors
This lets you customize the values at which color transitions occur. 
You can enter as many values as you wish, as a comma separated list, but make sure the values are in increasing order. 
Default is -9;0.

The last value always defines the clip level, which will be indicated in red.
