# Basic operation

## Compute the delay
Press the ![](include/Find.png) button to find the delay using the most recent incoming audio. 
The resulting figure is displayed almost instantly as a:

* Delay in samples (smp).
* Distance in meters (m) or Imperial feet (ft.) depending on whether Metric system is enabled.
* Delay in milliseconds (ms).

## Compensate the delay
Pressing the ![](include/On.png) button activates a delay line in the source signal path to compensate for the currently displayed delay value, effectively time-aligning <i>source</i> and <i>response</i> signals. 
Pressing again deactivates the delay line, which allows for quick comparison between uncompensated and compensated signal paths.

## Fine-tune manually
If necessary, you can manually adjust the delay figure
using either of these methods:

* Direct keyboard numeric value entry as time or distance figure.
* Increment / decrement by clicking the / icons.
* Increment / decrement using the +/- numeric keys.

## Perform a new measurement
Press the ![](include/Find.png) button again to perform a new measurement. 
This will overwrite any previous value.
