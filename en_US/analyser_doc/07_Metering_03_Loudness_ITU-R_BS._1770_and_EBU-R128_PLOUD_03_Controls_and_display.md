# Controls and display

## Display
The meter display has the following arrangement

* left bar: Momentary Loudness value

* right bar: Short-term Loudness

* text overlay: Integrated Loudness and
Loudness Range (LU) values, Gated indicator lights red when gate is active

## Pause
Clicking the ![](include/Pause.png) button pauses measurement; clicking again resumes it. 
This allows you to make adjustments without affecting Integrated Loudness, instead of having to start all over again.

## Reset
Clicking the ![](include/Refresh.png) button resets the meter to its initial state.

> Don't forget to reset the Loudness meter if you're starting playback of a new track, as Integrated Loudness, by design, measures the overall Loudness since the last reset. 
> Otherwise you'd be measuring the overall Loudness of the combined tracks, which is probably not what you want.
