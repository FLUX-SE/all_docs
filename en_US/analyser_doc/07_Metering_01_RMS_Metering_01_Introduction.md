# Introduction

RMS stands for Root Mean Square, is a measure of the average magnitude of a varying signal, or equivalently, the average power over the signal over a time period, called the integration time.

>The live layouts display dB [SPL](07_Metering_01_RMS_Metering_04_SPL.md) (Sound Pressure Level) values, which is the standard measure of acoustic pressure. 
>This requires that your input chain first be calibrated in order to get accurate and meaningful readings, as factors such as your particular microphone's sensitivity and preamplifier gain are not known in advance. 
>For this, you will need to get your hands on a calibrator, which is a box fitted with a transducer that outputs a known acoustic level and features a socket designed to hold the microphone.
