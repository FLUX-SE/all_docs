# Hold info text
When this button is disengaged, textual information overlays displayed above curves are held until the button is engaged again. This allows you to check a particular value precisely, such as an amplitude, gain, or phase at a particular frequency determined by the mouse cursor position when the switch was engaged. The most convenient to use this feature is to use the corresponding keyboard shortcut (*F6*).

# Full-screen mode

# Close
Exits the application.

# Help / about
