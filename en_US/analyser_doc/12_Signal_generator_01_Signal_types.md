# Pink noise
Pink noise is a random signal with an amplitude falloff inversely proportional to frequency.
This is the most commonly employed variety noise in audio measurement, as it a constant-energy perceived content.

# White noise
White noise is a random signal with constant energy across the audio range.
Compared to pink noise, it sounds much brighter as it has more energy in high-frequencies.
Commonly employed for electronic apparatus measurements.

# Sine
Fixed-frequency, pure tone generator.

# Sweep
Generates a variable tone from start to end frequencies.
Linear and logarithmic variants are available.
Log. sweep is best suited for audio measurements as this corresponds to constant time per octave.
