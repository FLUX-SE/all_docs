## (7) Decay time
This is the duration of the reverberation ‘tail’ in seconds, in other words how long it takes for the reverberated 
sound to vanish away. In more technical terms, this is sometimes referred to as the RT factor, which is the time at 
which the response of the reverberation to an input signal goes below -60dB of attenuation.


Please bear in mind that the master decay and high/mid/low controls are interactive, which means that the same audible 
result can be attained with different settings. This is intentional, as this allows you to get to the result faster 
and in a manner suited to your personal habits.
Generally speaking, it might be more convenient to adjust the master decay time using the resulting sound as a guideline, 
then fine tune using high and/or low decay controls and leave the mid decay at the default setting. On the other hand, 
if you specifically to concentrate on the mids, for example to create a ‘hollow room’ sound, it’s easier to focus on 
the mid decay control, leaving hi and mid decay untouched.

## (8) Room size
This parameter is a meta parameter that allow you to quickly perform an homogeneous set of parameters for the early
reflexions part (early + cluster). Theses part are particularly important to achieve the “room” feeling of the desired space.
It adjust the time structure of the whole reverberation (early-min, early-max, cluster-min, cluster-max, 
reverb-start). This is a key control for quick settings, before a detailed fi ne tune with each parameters.

## (9) PreDelay
PreDelay controls the time at which the reverberation portion of the effect starts to be heard, with respect to the DIRECT
signal. Increasing this helps to distinguish between direct and effected sound and preserve intelligibility, especially with
large decay times and room sizes which would otherwise drench the audio material in reverberation.
