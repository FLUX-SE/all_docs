# Introduction

**EVO EQ - The canvas for painting the colors**

One of the cornerstones in a Channel Strip is a well-built, efficient and complete Equalizer.
The equalizer in the EVO Channel and EVO EQ is a straightforward comprehensive 4-band parametric equalizer with an additional low/high shelf and a 6-24 dB low/high cut filter.

The graphical interactive EQ curve is layered on top of the built in Spectrum Analyzer for hands-on editing with direct connection to the visual response.

The spectrum analyzer originates from the FLUX:: Analyzer and has been optimized for the EVO Channel and EVO EQ. It gives you an accurate direct view of whatâ€™s going on in the different frequency domains of your material.
