The preset manager contains two preset banks, the Factory bank contains factory presets, this bank is not
available for saving of presets but any of the presets can be loaded into a preset slot and then saved into, the
User bank, where all user presets are saved.

In the preset manager, any preset can be loaded into a preset slot by double clicking on the name of the desired
preset in the actual preset list, the preset will then be loaded into the preset slot corresponding to the position of
the morphing slider.

When saving or editing a preset, an option to protect the preset is presented. The preset protection, if engaged,
only allows the original preset author to uncheck and edit the preset. This means that you can protect your
presets in a multi-user configuration. Protected presets can only be modified using the session used for their
creation. If used in another user session they can only be imported or deleted.
