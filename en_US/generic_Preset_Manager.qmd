In the preset manager, any preset can be loaded into a preset slot by double clicking on the name of the desired preset in the actual preset list, the preset will then be loaded into the preset slot corresponding to the position of the morphing slider.

When saving or editing a preset, an option to protect the preset is presented. The preset protection, if engaged, only allows the original preset author to uncheck and edit the preset. This means that you can protect your presets in a multi-user configuration. Protected presets can only be modified using the session used for their creation. If used in another user session they can only be imported or deleted.
