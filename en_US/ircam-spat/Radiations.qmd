## (19) Distance
Distance from the source to the center reference point (listener position), in meters.


## (20) Azimuth
Angle between the source location and the listener-front reference axis, in degrees.


## (21) Yaw
Angle of the source direction orientation relative to the listener-source axis, in degrees.


## (22) Relative direction
When engaged, the source movement done with the mouse in the display are done in a way that the source
always keep the same source-listener orientation.  
If not, the source direction is constant.

## (23) Elevation
Elevation angle, in degrees.

:::{.callout-note}
Please note that when the source is not located onto the base horizontal plane, at listener ear level (z = 0), a small gauge is
displayed on the right edge of the preview, which gives the distance of the source to listener projected onto the Z axis, for easier
handling of elevation.

## (24) Pitch
Source direction orientation pitch angle, in degrees.

:::{.callout-note}
Please pay attention to the fact that the graphic preview cannot not display pitch movements because of the 2D projection constraints.

## (25) Aperture
The aperture parameter relates to the "sound cone" projected by the virtual source in the acoustic space, and is measured in
degrees. It determines wether the source will be very directive (small aperture), or omnidirectional (large aperture) inside the
reverberant environment. You can use this parameter to simulate the how a source will interact with its acoustical environment.

Each source has a set of two three-band equalizers associated with it, as described below.
