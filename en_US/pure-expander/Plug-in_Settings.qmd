# Plug-in Settings

Pressing the cogwheels in the top right corner opens a settings window providing information about the plug-in
version/build, a direct access button to the user manual, as well as setup for latency report and OSC (Open Sound
Control). OSC is available in Pure Expander only, and is not supported in Pure Expander Studio Session.
