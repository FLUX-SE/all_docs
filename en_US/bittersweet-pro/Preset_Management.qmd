# Preset Management

BitterSweet Pro, as well as all other Flux:: plug-ins, provides two preset slots referred to as slot A and slot B, which provide access to two sets of parameter settings simultaneously. In addition to just recall the settings for each of the slots individually and alternate between their settings, a morphing slider is provided offering the possibility to morph between the slots and their corresponding settings. When clicking on one of the preset slots, the built in preset manager appears.

## Preset Sections

BitterSweet Pro provides two preset sections referred to as section A and section B, offering simultaneous access to two full sets of parameter settings. Clicking the A section (bottom left) or the B section (bottom right), or clicking the arrow in the Current Selected Preset display, opens a new window accessing the built-in preset manager.

## Save

Save replaces the selected preset by a new one under the same name featuring the current settings. If you want to keep an existing preset without your new modifications, just select an empty place into the preset list, enter a new name for this modified preset featuring the current settings and press Save.

## Recall

Once a preset is selected from the preset list it must be explicitly loaded into section A or the section B by using the recall button. A preset is effective only after it has been recalled.

## Copy A / Copy B

The current parameters of a section are copied to the other one. The section A or B is re-initialized with the current values and the morphing slider is parked at 100% of the corresponding section.

## Morphing Slider

Morphs the parameter values of both parameter sections, it has no unity or specific value display; it provides morphing of the current values from both of the parameter sections (A & B). A double-click on one side of the slider area toggles between the two parameter sections. The actual result of the morphed parameter settings can be saved as a new preset.
