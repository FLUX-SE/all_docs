# Geek

Clicking the Geek glasses opens a window with an additional range of parameters providing extended control of the transient processing envelope.

## Diff.

Diff. is a key listener for the Difference between input and output signal (at the final output, after the clipper).  

**Value Range:** Enabled/Disabled  
**Default Value:** Disabled  

## Bandwidth

**Value Range:** Static BW/Dynamic BW/Flat Sum  
**Default Value:** Static BW

Static bandwidth provides a constant Q factor, no matter of the gain factor of the filter. It's computed by having a constant bandwidth at +- 3 dB from 0 dB.

Dynamic bandwidth provides a dynamic Q factor, dependent on the gain factor of the filter. It's computed by having a constant bandwidth at +- 3 dB from peak levels of the filter.

Flat Sum is a more traditional way of computing the Q factor. The bandwidth is constant for the gain factor divided by two.

## Attack

Adjusts the attack time for the transient processing envelope.  

**Value Range:** 0.00 ms / 200.00 ms  
**Default Value:** 0.00 ms  

## Hold

Adjusts the hold time for the transient processing envelope.  

**Value Range:** 0.00 ms / 200.00 ms  
**Default Value:** 0.00 ms  

## Release

Adjusts the release time for the transient processing envelope.  

**Value Range:** 0.00 ms / 500.00 ms  
**Default Value:** 0.00 ms
