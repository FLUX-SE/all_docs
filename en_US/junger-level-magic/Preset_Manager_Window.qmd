# Preset Manager Window

The preset manager contains three preset banks:

- Factory bank - Contains factory presets. Saving presets in the Factory bank is not allowed, but any of the Factory 
presets can be recalled into a preset section and then saved into the User bank instead.
- User Bank - Contains user presets only.
- Global bank - Contains Global presets. A Global preset is a complete snapshot with all the settings from both
of the preset sections as well as the position of the Preset A/B Switch (34).

## Preset Protection

When saving or editing a preset an option to protect the preset is presented. The preset protection, if engaged, permits 
only the original preset author to disable the protection and edit the preset. This means that you can protect
your presets in a multi-user configuration. Protected presets can only be modified using the session used for their
creation. If used in another user session they can only be imported or deleted.
