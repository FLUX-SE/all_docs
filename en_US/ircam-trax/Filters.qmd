## (36) Filter Curve
The filter curve displays the overall frequency response of the filter section.


## (37) High Pass
Inserts a 6dB/octave high pass filter in the signal chain.


## (38) High Pass On
Toggles the High Pass Filter in and out.


## (39) Post High Pass
Determines whether the filter acts on the input or output signal. When off, which is the default setting, the 
corresponding frequencies are filtered out prior to analysis and transformation, which
can be used to prevent possible tracking errors induced by any excessive rumble or mains interference picked up during 
recording. If you only want to equalize the signal, enable Post to circumvent this behaviour.

## (40) Low Pass
Inserts a 6dB/octave low pass filter in the signal chain.

## (41) Low Pass On
Toggles the Low Pass Filter in and out.

## (42) Post Low Pass
See 39.
