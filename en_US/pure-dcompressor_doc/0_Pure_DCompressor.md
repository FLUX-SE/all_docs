Pure DCompressor is the de-compressor section of the Solera. A De-compressor must be used to automatically increase the
peak dynamic. Pure DCompressor allows you to restore the original dynamic of a sound. It‘s very useful for heavily compressed
signal. Pure DCompressor adds some naturalness. 

The Threshold value is expressed in dB – The plug-in compares it to the RMS
(Root Mean Square or effective power) of the input signal. This value is displayed as a green rectangle on the input level meter.
The level variations above the threshold are affected by the Ratio value. For a 1:1 de-compressor ratio, the processed signal
isn’t affected by the processing: A 1 dB variation above the threshold at the input is reflected by a 1 dB variation at the output.
Let’s apply now a 3:1 ratio. If the input signal rises above 1 dB the threshold value, the output signal rises from 3 dB: Here is the
de-compressor action. The input signal gain is increased by a 3:1 ratio above the threshold point.   

The Knee sets how progressive is the start up of the compressor action – In other words, It smoothes the transition 
point between no processing and full processing. If the Knee value expressed in dB is increased, the progressiveness of 
the action will be spread below and above the threshold point. The Range value sets the processing maximum action. 
No gain variation can exceed this value.
