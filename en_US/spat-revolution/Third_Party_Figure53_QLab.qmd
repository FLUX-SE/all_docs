# Figure53 QLab {#sec-qlab}

Rock solid and fully featured show control program, based under a 'cue' based paradigm, QLab is excellent for manually sequencing multiple media and show type events, running video, sound, lights, and virtually any type of control scripts through its easy-to-use interface.
Some of the more advanced control features in QLab make the most of its native OSC network integration - which is why it becomes a great integration partner to _SPAT Revolution_.

## QLab 5

Starting with QLab5, the network type cue (OSC messages) has been substantially revamped and now includes support to control SPAT Revolution directly. Over 100 predefined messages for SPAT Revolution are currently possible, including project, source, room, master, and snapshot control messages.

![QLab5](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/QLab5.png)

Earlier provided templates (QLab 4) of actual examples of remote control messages for SPAT Revolution are no longer needed to assist with programming. <!--Some QLab 5 templates are now available strictly to provide examples on how to use the SPAT Send plugin on cue outputs to route audio directly into SPAT Revolution application (when on a single computer, such as in creation)-->

## QLab 5 Integration template

New QLab 5 template will be provided shortly.


## QLab 4 Integration template (V4 validated)

This template shows how to manage _SPAT Revolution_ and QLab integration on the same machine, using _SPAT Revolution_ Send plugins. Both QLab and _SPAT Revolution_ sessions are included, with 16 Mono and 8 Stereo SPAT Send on cue outputs.
This template is _SPAT Revolution_ Essential compliant for binaural and Channel-based setups.

QLab templates are available in EURO and US versions, using commas or periods for denoting the decimal. (such as the decimal used in interpolation time)

## Generic QLab Templates (V4, compliant with V5)


This template shows how to manage _SPAT Revolution_ snapshots within QLab and have some carts for quick actions. It demonstrates how interpolation time value can be used in the snapshot recall messages.

**QLab _SPAT Revolution_ OSC Message examples**


This template is our updated template and includes many cue examples using various message types in SPAT Revolution.

Beyond direct cue send actions, it brings 1D and 2D fade (Parameter ramp, 2D trajectories, and more).
As of QLab4, there is a time interpolated 2D fade system for creating spatial XY gestures or similar multi-parameter control ideas.
X/Interpolation time value can always be used directly in your messages, as shown in some template examples.
With the latest release of _SPAT Revolution_, the ability to send messages to the currently selected source (s) with index -1 is also shown in this template.

## Configuring QLab -> SPAT for messages via network cues

In a real-time situation, where performers or sounds are being spatialized live by _SPAT Revolution_, and cues need to be sent in the right running order with the rest of the show, Network OSC type cues can be sent from QLab to _SPAT Revolution_ to control all aspects of the SPAT rendering software.
To do this interaction, setting up the OSC communication is necessary. It is relatively straightforward.
_In the _SPAT Revolution_ preferences, ensure the OSC Enable is engaged._

:::{.callout-note}
Enable commands log to view the commands and confirm you are receiving data (```Shift + F7``` will open the log window). It is recommended to leave it active only sometimes, as it takes some system resources.

**Setting the OSC Connection**
![Setting the OSC Connection](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/Preference/OSCConnectionCustomLocalHost.png)

Go to the OSC connection section of _SPAT Revolution_ and:

* Change the pull-down menu from *None* to the *Input | Custom* preset (meaning you are setting an OSC Input of Spat).

* Select the network interface you want to be receiving the commands from. Doing a local integration of QLab will require you to choose the localhost/loopback address ```127.0.0.1```.

* Unless you already use the Port ```8000``` proposed, you do not need to change it. This is the corresponding QLab Network Patch Output Port used in templates.


**QLab Workspace Settings / Network**

On the QLab side, use the Network Patch settings to configure OSC destinations.
One of them can be SPAT.

You can now send OSC network cues from QLab to SPAT, and control **most if not all parameters** of this virtual environment using [Appendix C - OSC and ADM-OSC Table -@sec-appendix-osc-table].
Once you get the hang of it, this is really very straightforward.
