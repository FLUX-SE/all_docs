# Solid State Logic SSL Live Consoles


As of version 4.11, SSL now supports Open Sound Control (OSC).
SSL Live consoles can now remotely control other devices over their connectivity network ports.
This is a bidirectional integration for _SPAT Revolution_.

## Template

A simple template is available for downloading, providing a starting point to configure this integration.

**[Solid State Logic SSL Live v4.11 - _SPAT Revolution_ 20.12 template](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/CSWr2SGggU6bbdZfTysp6LXj)**

## Setting up SSL Live console

* Go to ```MENU/Setup Option /EXTERNAL CONTROL``` to configure remote control.

* Rename the Generic OSC to SPAT OSC and enter the SPAT Computer IP address.

* Set In port # to ```9301``` and Host RX Port # to ```9300```.
  They will match the SSL Live OSC Input and Output connection presets in _SPAT Revolution_.

* Make sure to Enable OSC and note the Control IP Address. This address will be needed when configuring SPAT OSC.

With Solid State Logic live consoles, up to eight *Fader* (i.e., continuously variable) and eight *Switch* parameters per third-party device channel may be defined for control by the console.
These control parameters (OSC messages) going out to _SPAT Revolution_ source/objects are accessible from each console audio path and dedicated OSC paths with no associated console audio processing.
The provided template has all these configurations done for you, but you can decide to customize with different or fewer parameters.
