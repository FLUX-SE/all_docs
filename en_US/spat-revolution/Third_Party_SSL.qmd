## Setting up SSL Live console

* Go to ```MENU/Setup Option /EXTERNAL CONTROL``` to configure remote control.

* Rename the Generic OSC to SPAT OSC and enter the SPAT Computer IP address.

* Set In port # to ```9301``` and Host RX Port # to ```9300```. 
  They will match the SSL Live OSC Input and Output connection presets in _SPAT Revolution_.

* Make sure to Enable OSC and note the Control IP Address. This address will be needed when configuring SPAT OSC.

With Solid State Logic live consoles, up to eight *Fader* (i.e. continuously variable) and eight *Switch* parameters per third-party device channel may be defined for control by the console. 
These control parameters (OSC messages) going out to _SPAT Revolution_ source/objects are accessible from each console audio path as well as dedicated OSC paths with no console audio processing associated with them. 
The provided template has all these configurations done for you but you can decide to customize with different or less parameters.
