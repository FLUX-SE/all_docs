## Navigation bar

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Generic/TopBar.png)

The Navigation bar appears at the top of all views. As well as links to different editor views and to the preference, it also offers you the possibility to mute and unmute rooms.

The status and help bars appear at the bottom of all views. It gives information about the status of audio connections, sample rate, block size and through latency. Some inline help also appears here when the mouse moves over elements of the _SPAT Revolution_ graphical user interface. The _Provide feedback_ button sends a message directly to FLUX:: Immersive support which automatically includes your system information for our support team.

## Status bar

The status bar help you easily monitor many critical information about your hardware and your incoming or outgoing audio stream.

### Input stream

Allows monitoring the good reception of audio through LAP.
+ When "No connection" is displayed, this means that no SPAT Send plug-in with LAP enabled is seen by  _SPAT Revolution_.
+ When a connection is validated, it should provide a timecode, corresponding to the DAW transport position.
+ If the sample rate or block size is unmatched between _SPAT Revolution_ and the DAW used, the "all in sync" mention will turn red and count the sync errors.

### Hardware device

This section helps you monitor your audio hardware and how it interacts with  _SPAT Revolution_.

+ You can see the name of your input & output device.
+ The block size and sample rate of  _SPAT Revolution_.
+ The whole latency of the system. This depends on the block size and on the selected audio interfaces. Using different audio interfaces can result in a higher latency.

### Timecode source

Here, you can choose which timecode _SPAT Revolution_ should look at.

+ By default, it is set to "Absolute". It refers to the clock of your computer, no matter of the connection with an audio interface or with LAP streams.
+ "LAP Send" looks at the clock provided by SPAT Sends plug-ins.
+ "LAP Return" looks at the clock provided by SPAT Returns plug-ins.
+ "Audio hardware" looks at the clock provided by the selected audio interfaces.

### Timecode

Let you monitor the timecode seen by  _SPAT Revolution_. For proper operation of snapshots and automations, it should be always running.

### Clock source

Choose what clock SPAT should follow.
+ Internal.
+ Hardware.
+ Auto : use hardware if one is connected.

### Support

Allows to send feedback to the FLUX:: Immersive support team.

:::{.callout-note}
With Send/Return plug-ins, if sampling rate and block size between DAW and _SPAT Revolution_ are different, the status bar will be red. Double-click on this bar to automatically change them into _SPAT Revolution_.

## Snapshot bar

![Snasphot toolbar](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Generic/SnapshotToolbar.png)

This toolbar has been designed to help to handle snapshots without navigating to the snapshots page. Some of the most important snapshot actions will be found on it:
- Recall the ```Previous``` snapshot.
- The name of the ```Current``` snapshot. Clicking on it will display the snapshot list, enabling to recall any snapshot of the list.
- Recall the ```Next``` snapshot.
- ```Update``` the current snapshot.
- Enable or disable the ```Relative Recall```.
- ```Propagate``` values between snapshots.

_This bar can be hided on the snapshot panel of the __Preference__ page._

More information about snapshot can be found on the **[snapshots page -@snapshot]**.
