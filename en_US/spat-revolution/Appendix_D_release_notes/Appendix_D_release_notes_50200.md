# Known Issues
- AAX PI - Win10 -  Renaming an instance cut the send of the SPAT send. Re-enable the LAP to fix it.
- AU - Logic - Changing a send plugin from slot with GUI opened may crash
- Bad GUI initialization on Windows
- Broadcast OSC messages are not received on macOS. Have to use unicast
- Core Audio headphones and loudspeakers cannot be used without an aggregate
- HOA preset input: selecting B-Format or Custom with SID sorting may only connect the first channel of the input block
- LAP - Tail reverb is not reported to the plugins when IO devices are "None" in SPAT Revolution
- OSC - Rotation X,Y and Z and Scale buttons aren't refreshed on automation and OSC message reception
- OSC - Selecting a source when receiving AED message blocked his azimuth and elevation
- PI - AAX - Renaming the send track in protools changes the corresponding source verb enable, early, cluster and tail
- Position are not sent when dumping all properties through OSC on opening a session
- S6L integration, SPAT Send track name is not retained properly and sent every time the UI opens (erasing your SPAT Source name).
- The second OSC output status is not retained in AAX / AAX VENUE.  Make sure to enable it after a reboot or an AAX host rack reset.
- VST - Pyramix - Crash when quiting session with SPAT Send and LAP enable
- VST - Pyramix/Ovation - Crash on reloading mixer with Send/Return with Pyramix versions earlier than 14 / Ovation versions earlier than 10.
- When multiple sources are selected, moving some "filtered" parameter like distance in the property panel may generate bad position values
- Win10 - /source/1/dump message doesn't work
- Windows - A process still running after quitting SPAT Revolution when ASIO4ALL is used as audio driver
- macOS - Reported latency is not accurate when Device In/Out are the same
