# Release Notes - Build 22.02.0.50148

## New features

- Sources - Add one gain per room - Parameter name: Room specific gain
- New parameter Room Reverb "Enable" to enable or disable all reverb components for all connected sources in the room
- New HybridVBAP - A new panning technique for 3D arrangements that mixes 2D ad 3D VBAP depending on the elevation of the source
- AU plugin integration for Apple Logic Pro up to 10.7 and Figure 53 QLab
- Support of separated hardware input and output devices
- Wave Field Synthesis spatial reproduction technique algorithm available as new panning type - supporting collinear system as well as potentially any 2D/3D arrangements. (WFS add-on license required, Ultimate only)
- New Output Matrix: Allows on Master and Master Transcoder modules several connections per output on channel-based stream type
- New efficiency zone: where it makes sense to position the sources. Two behaviors for sources: clamp on the zone or mute outside
- Speaker orientation on speaker editor, automatically set according to the arrangement shape. This orientation is only taken into account on WFS panning type.
- New sources solo clear button
- New elevation clamping - Source-object is projected on speaker extremum planes for 3D channel-based speaker arrangements
- New option "Source fit speaker elevation" in the protection section of Room output panel: render a 3D creation on 2D setups will be more coherent
- Official support for software input (Local Audio Path via plugin) and hardware output in the same session.
- SPAT Revolution Essential - Now supports up to 16 channel arrangements

## Improvements

### Spatial Processing

### Core optimization
- Huge jitter reduction, especially with small buffer values (e.g. 256 amp @ 96 kHz)
- Up to 20% improvements on single or multi-core configuration

### Various

- Add "strict" keyword in source parameter filter to strictly define which parameter to display. e.g. "strict: gain distance"
- Add source parameter filter presets on source parameter panel
- Add Main Menu access from the Main UI Header. Therefore, we can access main menu even in full screen
- Hide system menu in fullscreen
- Improve loading time when starting SPAT revolution when there is no internet connection

## Bugs fixes

### Spatial Processing
- Add distance scaling support for source "Scale" and "Radius" (if different from default)
- Fix presence vector not drawn over the listener head in certain cases
- Create or edit an arrangement through the setup wizard now change the width of the protection zone and the distance scaling
- Source's pitch displayed could be wrong
- Multichannel sources rotate the source of 90Â° when distance set to 0
- Doppler effect is not working anymore

### OSC
- Preferences/OSC connections - Fix refresh issue on OSC sockets when IP and port already used
- Reverb density is not recalled by snapshots
- OSC - Fix possible issue with /global OSC command
- Fix OSC messages consistency in regard to packed or unpacked queries
- Preferences/OSC connections - Add missing distance transformation for ADM-OSC presets
- Preferences/OSC connections - Fix possible error on OSC Transform windows
- "/source/[index]/name/get", "/room/[index]/name/get" and "/master/[index]/name/get" don't work anymore

### 3D View
- Fix some drawing issues on clamping, presence factor and radius
- Speaker Alpha setting is now applied to all rooms

### Binaural
- Binaural - No direct sound with SphericalHeadModel and SnowManModel

## Known Issues

### Most important
- WARNING: Generator on room output channel is after gain and mute. Use with precaution, change the level in the generator section of the preference page or on the MASTER module.
- ALT modifier doesn't work on Windows
- Position are not sent when dumping all properties through OSC on opening a session
- macOS - Reported latency is not accurate when Device In/Out is the same
- Issue with source slider which doesn't work all time
- Core Audio headphones and loudspeakers cannot be used without an aggregate
- when multiple sources are selected moving some "filtered" parameter like distance in the property panel may generate bad position values
- S6L integration, SPAT Send track name is not retained properly and sent every time the UI opens (erasing your SPAT Source name).
- REAPER/WIN10 - VST - Automation reset source position
- REAPER/WIN10 - VST - ReaVolution script can't create mono send
- PI - AAX - Renaming a send track in ProTools changes the corresponding source verb enable, early, cluster and tail
- Double-clicking on "Input stream" on the status bar resets to default the hardware buffer and sampling rate if no Send/Return
- Connect a Send input to a source reset all parameters

### Important
- Win10 - /source/1/dump messages doesn't work
- OSC - Rotation X,Y and Z buttons aren't refreshed on automation and OSC message reception
- The second OSC output status is not retained in AAX / AAX VENUE. Make sure you enable it after a reboot or an AAX host rack reset.
- Broadcast OSC messages are not received on macOS. Workaround: use unicast
