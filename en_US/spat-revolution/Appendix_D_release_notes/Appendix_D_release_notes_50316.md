- Add Auto Touch/Release for remotes that are not doing it
- Add OSC send option for selection
- Add absolute / trim when tweaking multiselection property
- Core - Propose to empty preferences when crashing on load
- DSP - Add phase inversion of the signal for Inputs, Sources, Rooms, and Masters
- Group of sources
- New speaker arrangements with all main DAW arrangements, with new arrangement categories

# Improvements
- 3D View - Display signal activity in real source position and group, like in standard sources
- Add Stereo to LCR encode on the input block
- Add signal generator options
- Better readability of Question and info Dialog box
- Better readability of Transform dialog
- Core - Performance improvements in automation, OSC, snapshots and audio processing
- Core - Source LFE channel is now sent to non-LFE channels if the room does not have an LFE
- Engine - Preferred number of cores on macOS is now performances core minus one. This provides better results with OSC, automation, and snapshots
- HRTF - Add a message to prevent when the default HRTF library is missing, and check if the HRTFs file exists before loading a session.
- OSC - Improve bi-directionality for snapshots. Each snapshot change sends an OSC message. It also accepts range, * flag, "get", "/?" and "dump".
- OSC - Positions are not sent when dumping all properties through OSC on opening a session
- OSC - Send previous, current, and next snapshot name
- On Mac OS, clicking on the close (red) button may now ask to quit the application
- Source Header - Name requires now to double-click on the label to edit it
- feed signal generator before processing delay on the input block

# Bugs
- 3D view - Barycenter is not updated when selecting several sources through the 3D view

- At session load, plugins transmit their automation through both OSC and LAP when LAP is engaged.
- Core - Changing IO Block Size may corrupt audio or crash
- Core - Changing the Engine's number of cores may kill audio playback
- Core - LFE of a source does not pass automatically to room LFE

- Preferences - Shortcuts dialog is broken
- Protools - WIN - More than one return in LAP makes the DAW crash
- ReIndex in Spat Revo Plugins
- Room - When multiple sources are selected, moving some "filtered" parameter like distance in the property panel may generate bad position values
- SPAT Send - Crash Pyramix when closing session if LAP enabled
