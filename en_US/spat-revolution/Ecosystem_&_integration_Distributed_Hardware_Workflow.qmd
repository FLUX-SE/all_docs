# Distributed Hardware Workflow

Routing via hardware IO means that in principle the audio can arrive at SPATâ€™s hardware inputs via MADI or other high channel interconnect from another machine handling the audio playback (and/or recording). 
This is a powerful and reliable combination as it shares audio computational resources.

Furthermore, a single machine setup can be converted to a fully automated distributed using OSC to target the single or dual SPAT engine for a real time controllable and interactive distributed hardware setup.

 _Enable bidirectional OSC communication in SPAT preferences to send automation over the network to another machine._ Contact Flux Support if you need to expert support on this kind of advanced distributed setup.
