# Output {#source-room-modules-output-section}

The main thing to note at the output stage is that you can have any number of output routes.
Like the [Inputs -sec-input-modules], they may be either direct hardware routes, which returns audio streams (via matrix routing) to the physical outputs of an audio interface connected to your _SPAT Revolution_ workstation.
The Hardware Output workflow is the most direct way to render in realtime to an actual loudspeaker system (or headphones).

:::{.callout-warning}
 Software outputs are created by the instantiation of a SPAT Return plug-in in a compatible DAW, when its local audio path is set to "on".
:::

Outputs may also be linked to _SPAT Revolution_ RETURN plug-ins, which returns audio streams internally on the same workstation to a valid SPAT RETURN plug hosted in your DAW.
The software RETURN workflow offers an easy way to render the spatial scene to disk, as _Ambisonic encoded_, _Binaural encoded_ or _Sound system encoded_ multichannel audio.

:::{.callout-note}
Create multiple output routes to capture Ambisonic recordings at the same time as sound system specific rendering.
