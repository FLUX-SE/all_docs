## Hardware IO

![Hardware IO Section]( https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/HardwareIO.png)

The hardware IO panel allows choosing the audio interface that can be accessed by SPAT Revolution.

### Input/Output Devices

This menu allows selecting the audio interface. SPAT Revolution audio engine supports all devices compatible with ASIO (Windows) or CoreAudio (macOS).

:::{.callout-warning}
**Note that you should select “None” when using the Local Audio Path connections.**

SPAT Revolution audio engine also supports different input and output interfaces, on both macOS and Windows, for maximum flexibility.

In the case of different input and output devices, the sample rate and the block size need to be the same.

:::

### Sampling Rate

Select the sampling rate used by the audio engine.

### Block Size

The block size defines the global latency added by SPAT Revolution. The lower it is set, the lower the latency is, but the greater the CPU consumption is.

### Show input/output settings

This button opens the driver audio panel of the selected interface, if it exists.

## User Interface

![User Interface Section]( https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/UserInterface.png)

This panel contains some general user preferences.

### Anti-Alias

When enabled, this option smooths out lines in the graphic engine.
If you are using an Intel-based computer without a dedicated GPU, we highly recommend deactivating this option to improve performance.

_On by default_

### Setup Wire

When on, the wires between blocks in the setup page are splined. When off, they are straight.

_On by default_

### Tooltips

Tooltips contain help and complementary information. When on, they are displayed when the mouse is over a parameter or a control.

### Theme

Allows switching between the dark theme and the light theme of SPAT Revolution.

_Set on “dark” by default_

### Shortcuts window

Display the list of all the shortcuts of SPAT Revolution.

## OSC Main

![OSC Main Section]( https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/OSCMain.png)

<!-- TODO: update this image -->

This panel contains basic OSC options.

### OSC Enable

Enable or disable the OSC communication between SPAT Revolution and other devices.

### Enable commands log

Allow displaying the OSC messages in the application’s console.

### Show invalid OSC input messages

Allow displaying the unknown and invalid OSC messages in the application’s terminal.

### Dump on socket change

Allow to dump all properties when a socket changes, i.e. when the IP address or the port number has been edited, or the socket is enabled. This ensures a constant synchronization between any remote control and SPAT Revolution.

### Send current selection messages

Allow sending a particular message for the source selection. For example, for the gain, the /source/-1/gain will be sent each time the selection gain change.

### Output rate

Define OSC output rates in milliseconds.

### Export Parameters

This button exports the OSC parameters to a text file.

## OSC Connections

![OSC Connections Section]( https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/OSCConnections.png)

This panel allows the creation of an OSC connection between SPAT Revolution and other devices, like tablets, phones, computers and many others. More information is available on the [OSC section -@sec-spat-osc].

## Snapshots

![Snasphot preferences](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/Snapshot.png)

### Recall sources name

Determines if the source names are recalled with snapshots.

### Number of saved versions

Determines the number of versions saved when updating a snapshot. Careful: increasing this number increases deeply the size of the .json SPAT file.

### Ask for update before recalling

When checked, a dialog will ask you if you want to update the snapshot before each recall.

## HRTF

![HRTF Section](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/HRTF.png)

The HRTF panel allows setting up some generic options for HRTF handling.

### Default HRTF

Choose the default HRTF used in the binaural room or binaural monitoring blocks

### Manage HRTFs - Ultimate license only

The button opens a window that allows downloading or removing HRTF. You can also import your own HRTF from this menu.

## Room

![Room Section](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/Room.png)

This panel allows changing some room properties.

### Room gain

Change the gain of all the rooms of SPAT Revolution.

### Compute LFE

Off by default, this option allows including the LFE position in the computing of the speaker alignment process.


### Speaker test post "mute/solo"

Change the behavior of the signal generator for speaker, pre or post-speaker's mute and solo.

### WFS default truncation distance of Efficiency zone for linear antenna

Add a distance offset to the efficiency zone when using WFS with a linear antenna to avoid issues with the focus zone.

## Signal Generator

![Signal Generator Section](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/SignalGenerator.png)

<!-- TODO: update this image -->

Here, you will find the options related to the test signals generated by the application itself.

### Gain

Configure the signal generator gain.

### Signal Type

Configure the type of signal generator.

### Sinus frequency

Configure the frequency of sinus.

### Sweep start frequency

Configure the start frequency of sweep.

### Sweep end frequency

Configure the end frequency of sweep.

### Sweep time

Configure the time sweep.

## Engine

![Engine Section](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/SpatR/Preference/Engine.png)

This panel allows to modify the behavior of the SPAT Revolution engine.

### Automation

#### Automation Rate

Define the automation rate in milliseconds.

### Audio Processing
#### Max Number Of Cores

Define the number of CPU cores used by the engine.

#### Parallel Profile

Define how the CPU resources are spread among the cores available. In _Max Distribution_ mode, the CPU resources are evenly spread among the available cores.
In _Favor First Core_, the engine will fill the CPU cores one by one. The _Balanced Distribution_ mode is a compromise between both.
