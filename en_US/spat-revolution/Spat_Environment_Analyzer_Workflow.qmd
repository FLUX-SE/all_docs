# FLUX:: Analyzer Workflow

_SPAT Revolution_ provides a close integration with the analyzer designed by FLUX::, [the FLUX:: Analyzer](https://www.flux.audio/project/flux-analyzer/), allowing to send audio directly to the FLUX:: Analyzer.


Nothing more simple to do it: on the *Setup Page*, select a block. On the list **Send to Analyzer**, select ```True```.
On the FLUX:: Analyzer, you will see it as a new Source, called "SPAT Revolution". Select it, and select the correct speaker arrangement into the Analyzer: that it's.
