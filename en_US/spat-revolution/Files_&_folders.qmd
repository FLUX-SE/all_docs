# Files and Folders

## Files type

SPAT uses 3 different file types:

* .json
* .ioconfig
* .reverbPresets

*.json* are the main files of  _SPAT Revolution_: sessions are saved in this file type.

To save a session, click on the "Save session" button on the Setup page, or use the shortcut ```Ctrl + S``` on Windows, or ```Cmd + S``` on Mac, on any page of  _SPAT Revolution_.

User-created custom speaker arrangement(s) can be exported or imported as *.ioconfig* files in the edit speaker config window.

Reverb preset can be stored and exported as *.reverbPresets.* They can later be imported back into a session.
