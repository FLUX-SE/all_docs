# Avid Pro Tools (2022 Update) {#sec-protools}

Avid Pro Tools is a leading DAW in the professional audio community and is far from new to the object-based mixing workflow.
_SPAT Revolution_ can use the AAX version of its plug-in suite SEND, RETURN and ROOM to establish connection between Avid Pro Tools and the _SPAT Revolution_ environment.
These plugins were created at the base to provide the automation link via OSC for local or remote integration.
All the SPAT plug-in parameters are made available to Pro Tools to record the immersive creation's metadata (automation).


## Workflow

As mentioned in the integration documents and troubleshooting guide, **using specific tracks (such as aux) as your SPAT object** is the best practice for dealing with these sources/objects you send for external rendering.
This way you can leave the session audio tracks and their channel insertions as they are, and simply send these audio tracks to the _SPAT Revolution_ object tracks.
This allows you to send a single audio track or multiple ones (stem) to the _SPAT Revolution_ object tracks.
With local audio integration (LAP) or alternate audio routing methods in single or dual computer setups (virtual audio bridge, network I/O, etc.), this approach is flexible.

## Templates

**Templates downloads**

New updated templates are available for use with Avid Pro Tools.  They are .ptxt session template files and can be used as examples to see how to integrate _SPAT Revolution_, using the SPAT plug-in suite SEND, RETURN and ROOM. While some templates use the Local Audio Path (LAP) feature, others rely on alternate audio devices such as audio bridge on single machine computer or other high channel count audio devices in dual computer setup.

The [Avid Pro Tools Session Templates](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/N48YKyqnBWXmMq1Fohskew8c) is a complete .zip package of all the 6 available templates and can be copied to your **Pro Tools Session Templates** folder.

## Setting Up Sync when using Local Audio Path (LAP)

With the latest release of _SPAT Revolution_, buffer size in Pro Tools needs to be set to 1024 samples, in both ProTools and _SPAT Revolution_ if using the Local Audio Path option.
In ProTools, go to *Setup/Playback Engine* then set H/W Buffer Size to 1024 samples.

:::{.callout-note}
We highly recommend de-activating dynamic Plug-in processing.
:::

![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProToolsEnginePlaybackMenu.png)

In SPAT, go to *Preferences/Hardware IO* , then set:


* Device: None
* External Sampling Rate: Enabled
* Block Size: 1024

### Latency compensation

### Setting Up Object Tracks

Setup a Protools session to work with SPAT Revolution using the Local Audio Path mode is simple.
Just add SEND and RETURN plug-ins and enable the 'Local Audio Path' (LAP) option for each.
Although SPAT plug-ins are instantiated when using FLUX Pro Tools templates or presets, they don't have the LAP activated by default. (Supporting standard audio routing of objects to SPAT Revolution as external renderer)

Once you engage the *Enable* switch, SEND software inputs should appear at the top of the SPAT Revolution setup environment page, and Return outputs at the bottom.

![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/Plugin/SendLAP.png)

![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/Setup/BlankLAP.png)

Select all the objects in the 'empty' signal graph using a drag select or Command click selection, then choose the 'connect selected' action.
A default module routing will be completed automatically with a default stereo virtual room.

<!-- ![img](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ConnectSelected.png) -->

Now you should be able to send and receive audio streams from/to Pro Tools and spatialize your objects.

### The SPATSync (aka dummy bus) and why

Quite simply, all tracks or Aux object tracks that have a SPAT SEND need to be outputting to a common bus feeding each the input SPAT RETURN buses, in order for the SPAT Send to be computed before the SPAT Return.
Using FLUX:: Immersive Pro Tools templates and sessions provided prevents the user having to do these steps.

A simple, nice and clean way to handle SPATSync bus for all scenarios and formats is to create a 16-channels ambisonic dummy bus (the largest bus that Pro Tools supports) and include all the sub arrangements from mono all the way to 3rd order ambisonic: HOA3, HOA2,  HOA1, Atmos 7.1.2, 7.1, 6.1, 5.1, 5, 4, LCR, Stereo and Mono. Whatever the track format SPAT SEND plug-in is, it can be sent to this dummy bus that can handle all the formats.
Then all these buses are available to feed any SPAT RETURN whatever the channel count.

This is the strategy used in templates.

### Pro Tools license versions

The Ultimate and Studio versions of Pro Tools are highly recommended because of the use of multichannel buses.
Using a version of Pro Tools below forces us to return our audio streams by groups of maximum two channels.
For example, you will need 12 SPAT RETURNS plug-ins (and 12 x 2-channels tracks) to return a 22.2 stream from _SPAT Revolution_.

This strategy is still used when dealing with channel-based format higher than the supported bus in Pro Tools.
So for example for a NHK 22.2 bus, we can return this to 3 x 8-channels (7.1) bus or to 2 x 16-channels ambisonic buses where only 8 channels will be used on the second bus.
So, Pro Tools Ultimate and Studio are highly recommended.
Pro Tools Advance Multi-format template for _SPAT Revolution_ reflects this.

<!-- ## Track presets

**FLUX:: Track presets for Pro Tools** is a simple strategy to rapidly add Send and Return objects into a Pro Tools session. **Session Templates** are great because they give a starting point.

SPAT Revolution is unique as it can deal with send sources/objects that can be mono, stereo, LCR and all the above (up to 16 channels with Pro Tools, 64 with other DAWs).
The same applies to the return busses as we are dealing with the various stream formats you can create for monitoring or rendering in SPAT Revolution.
Templates are often just a start point and do not reflect your desired session.

Welcome the **[Avid Pro Tools - Track Presets](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/ux78xLZDnjtihA3hm8xFKhCP)**.

Simply copy the **Track preset folder** to the Pro Tools track presets folder (/Documents/Pro Tools/Track Presets/Flux).
With this in place, you will have track presets that can be used for SEND and RETURN:

- Send Mono
- Send Stereo
- Send 5.1
- Send 7.1
- Send 7.1.2
- Send HOA 1
- Send HOA 2 (not supported on Essential)
- Send HOA 3 (not supported on Essential)
- Return Stereo
- Return Binaural
- Return Quad
- Return 5.1
- Return 7.1
- Return 7.1.2
- Return HOA 3

With these track presets, integrating SPAT Revolution in an existing session can be done simply.
Click on the output selection button of a track and choose "New Track".
A pop-up window will appear: choose "Track Presets/Flux" in the category.
Lastly, you'll find all the possible object send format accessible in Pro Tools.
Select the one that matches your initial track format or your desired object format.
This newly created object can be used by other audio tracks too. (Using it a stem object)


![track Presets](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProToolsTrackPreset.png)

If you also want to send multiple tracks to a single SEND object to SPAT, you can do it easily.
Select all tracks, old the option key and change the output of a track to New Track.
Click in type, choose "Track Presets/Flux" and then choose the format of the send object that you want.

![trackPreset1](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProtoolsSendNewTrack.png)

That’s it. All your selected tracks will be assigned to this newly created bus called SPAT Send, your SPAT source/object.
It’s an aux track containing your SPAT SEND plug-in instance ready to enable Local Audio Path or to route to external audio option (virtual audio bridge, network I/O). It’s your object track.
Moreover, this creates the "all-format" dummy bus mentioned above, and your Send Object track is already assigned to it.
You can do this on a single audio track or a series of tracks to send everything like a stem.

![trackPreset1](include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_protools_trackPreset1.gif)

Why create an aux SPAT send object without instantiating the plug-in directly on the audio track?
Although this is possible as well (and you have to make sure your audio tracks have the proper routing), this simply allows a post-fader send to SPAT Revolution, as plug-in insert in Pro Tools are always pre-fader.
Using the aux track model is simple, clean and allows for creating Send stems.

![trackPreset1](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProToolsDummyBus.png)

Last step, the RETURN plug-in. Create a new track.
Choose track presets, choose FLUX, and choose the required format.
SPAT RETURN plug-in will be instantiated on the newly created bus.
The bus is already fed from the dummy bus previously created and you don’t have to worry about the routing for synchronization!

## SPAT Source/Object Automation

To automate variable parameters in the SPAT rendering engine from Pro Tools automation lanes, activating the parameters for each plug-in instance first is necessary.
This is already done in the above templates and track presets.

![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProToolsEmptyAutomationEnable.png)

![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProToolsAutomationEnable.png)

To do this one by one can be a laborious task.
Save time by editing the Pro Tools preference for automation and enabling the '*Plug-in Controls Default to Auto-Enabled* ' option.
When inserting a plug-in, all its parameters will automatically be available for automation.

![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/SpatR/ThirdParty/ProToolsPreferencesAutomation.png)


### Source/Object Index, moving from LAP to OSC

Another thing to remember is that as you instantiate plug-ins, they automatically generate an Index # that gets used when in OSC mode (without local audio path enable).
So, if you take a template (or a fully deployed session) and delete a bunch of plug-in instances or create new instances, you end up with a mix of index numbers which may mean manually having to change them later.
That can be a tedious job when dealing with a larger session.
Granted this is not important when using LAP. Still, the day you decide to separate your playback of the rendering computer, disengaging the Local Audio Path (LAP), you end up with the same reality of Index # not reflecting your setup.

The rule of thumb is simple.
The index # presents the Source # in _SPAT Revolution_ and deleting (or re-ordering in the case of SPAT) will change the index number.
Using the plug-in in OSC mode will impact the source that the SPAT plug-in is speaking to.
