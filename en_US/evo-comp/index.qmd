# Introduction

**EVO Comp - The Sound Attitude Generator**

In addition to controlling the signal dynamics, the compressor is often used for shaping the attitude of a sound. To use a compressor in a creative and artistic fashion it’s important that it’s easy to use and has the ability to create an interesting sound.

The EVO Channel and EVO Comp compressor offers a wide range and variety of sound with nine different compression modes, and a Wet / Dry control for adjusting the level of compression, allowing for parallel compression within the module.
