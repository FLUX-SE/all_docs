## Analyser

### Analyser Switch

The spectrum analyzer origins from the Flux:: Pure Analyzer and has been optimized for the EVO Channel. It
gives you an accurate direct view of what’s going on in the different frequency domains of your audio. When
switched on, the spectrum analysis is activated and displayed in the equalization view panel. The grey
waveform correspond to your input signal (post gain/drive), the same as the input meter. The black one is the
output signal (post output gain), the same as the output meter.

Value Range : Enabled/Disabled

Default Value : Enabled

### Analyser Slider

Controls the amount of frequency detail of the curve. Move the slider to the left to get a more smoothed curved,
and to the right to get more details.

Value Range : No Value

## Input

### Input Gain

The input gain control trims the level of the signal at the input of EVO Channel. The meter shows both RMS
signal (VU-Meter, blue) and peak signal (peak meter, green), from -24 to +18 dB range, referenced at -18dB.


Value Range : -24.0 dB / +18.0 dB


Colors : 
- Blue : RMS Value 
- Green : Peak Value


Default Value : 0.0 dB

### Drive

In EVO Channel a signal Drive is available direct at the input Gain for restoring and maintaining the vitality of
the sound.

The drive module has been specially designed to add a soft saturation and warmth to your audio tracks.


Value Range : 0% / 100%



Default Value : 0%

## Phase

One of the most crucial parameters to take into account; Phase, or “The art of using multiple microphones on
one and the same sound source”, a classic example is when setting up the sound for a drumkit.

Controlling the Phase of microphones is universal and relevant both for studio and live use. In EVO Channel an
Arbitrary and Linear Phase Rotation throughout the spectrum is provided, to accomplish the same natural thing
as when physically moving a microphone, of course without adding any latency.

The phase must be enabled for all the drum tracks. Then set the same group number for all these tracks. It
allows to enable and disable the phase for all the drums in one click (simply switch on/off for the phase in one of
the tracks).

### Phase Switch

The Phase is the result of Flux:: proprietary research, this unique algorithm allows linear phase correction with
zero latency.

Activate the phase module on all of the tracks that were recorded at the same time and in the same room (multi-
microphones tracking or live recording in exemple), and then use the slider on the different tracks until you get
full control over the phase and everything sounds correct.

When enabled, the phase correction is turned on.


Value Range : Enabled/Disabled


Default Value : Disabled

### Phase Group

Add an EVO Channel instance to a Phase Group. You can add an instance of EVO Channel to a group, all the
members of the same group can then have their Phase enabled or disabled at one and the same time. To do
so, add the instance to a group by selecting the group number for the desired group. Now when you then turn
the phase switch on or off in any of the instances in the group, this will affect all instances that are members of
the same group.



Value Range : None/Group number


Number of groups : 8 groups


Default Value : Disabled


### Phase Correction

Set the shift value used to correct the phase.


Value Range : -180° / 180°


Default Value : 0°

When enabled, polarity inversion is applied to the signal.


Value Range : Enabled / Disabled


Default Value : Disabled

## Equalization module

One of the corner stones in a Channel Strip is a well-built, efficient and complete Equalizer.

The EVO Channel EQ is a straightforward comprehensive 4-band equalizer with additional 6-24 dB Hi/Lo filters.

The graphical interactive EQ curve is layered on top of the built in Spectrum Analyzer for hands-on editing with
direct connection to the visual response.

Built with our proprietary State-Space technology, like in Epure, the EQ section has been carefully tuned to
preserve the optimal signal to noise ratio independent of the parameter settings preventing the signal from
deteriorating when the gain is reduced. It’s an efficient sharp-edged surgical precision tool for the most
demanding equalizing and filtering tasks conceivable.

Equalization module is divided in two parts :
- A filtering part composed of a low cut, a low shelf, a high cut and a high shelf filter.
- A parametric equalization stage made of four parametric EQs.

## Compressor

In addition to controlling the signal dynamics, the compressor is often used for shaping the attitude of a sound.
To use a compressor in a creative and artistic fashion it’s important that it’s easy to use and has the ability to
create an interesting sound.

The EVO Channel’s compressor module is based on the Pure Compressor’s dynamics engine, and the same
range of compression types are available in EVO Channel through the different modes available (each mode
corresponds to a fine tuning of Pure Compressor). As some modes use a LID compression (Level Independent
Detection) in parallel, a gain reduction may be processed even if the audio level is below the threshold.

## Touch


Different types of material require different tools, whether it’s a vocal cut, drums, guitar, piano or something
else, it requires the accurate specific treatment for the material.

The Touch module in EVO Channel is a polymorphic section offering a variety of different processors designed
to adapt to the requirements of the material, with seven different processing modes including a DeEsser,
Expander and a Transient and Sustain Designer.

With the adjustable signal flow in EVO Channel the Touch module can be inserted where it’s best doing its job,
like having the DeEsser or Expander first in the flow, or the Transient designer after the compressor.
