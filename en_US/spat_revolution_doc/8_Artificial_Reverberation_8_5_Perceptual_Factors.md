# 8.5 Perceptual Factors

**Reverberance**

_Reverberance_ affects the amount by which the listener perceives the music to be
prolonged by the reverb, when the musical message suddenly stops. The effect of
this setting is also obvious when the source material is of percussive nature. _Reverberence_ is tightly related to overall decay time of mid- frequencies, which in turn is
the time taken by the late reflections to vanish into silence.

**Heaviness**

Relative decay time of low-frequency content, relative to the reverberance.

**Liveness**

Relative decay time of high-frequency content, relative to the reverberance. Describes the liveliness and movement associated with the reverb tail (late
reflections).
