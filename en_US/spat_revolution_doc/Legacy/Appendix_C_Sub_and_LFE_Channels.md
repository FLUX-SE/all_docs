# Sub and LFE Channels

In some standard surround formats for cinema - often denoted as _n.1 surround_ the _.1_ refers to a dedicated channel for extra sub bass effects in cinema. The LFE
channel is normally sent directly to the subwoofer speakers in a real room.

_SPAT Revolution_ does not model subwoofers or spatialize their acoustic information in the Virtual Rooms. But it does handle the channel in a special way.
When working in a purely Channel Based signal graph, with Channel Based
rooms outputting to a _n.1 surround_ speaker arrangement, each source will have
an individual _LFE Send_ which controls how much of its signal is sent to the LFE
channel at the output.

This parameter is available inside the room editor, but also available directly from
a source module in the _Environment Setup_ graph.
