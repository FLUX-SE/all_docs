# About this Guide

This guide has been written for practitioners already working in immersive sound production yet new to the Spat Revolution software environment. Is also intended to be read as a practical introduction to surround and immersive audio production for those who are new to the medium and coming to it through Spat Revolution. Of course, there is plenty more knowledge to be had in the field of immersive audio and the technology behind it, which will strengthen your understanding and decision making. 

We strongly suggest spending an hour or two to read through this guide before starting on your first major production and keep it on hand during the process. Expert support and advice can also be sought from the FLUX:: Immersive Consulting Group.

Let us start now with a practical guide on getting the software installed and running.
