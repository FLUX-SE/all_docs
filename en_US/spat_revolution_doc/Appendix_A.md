Computer optimization:
- Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth if not absolutely required.
- Disable Airdrop
- Disable Spotlight
- Disable display sleep, disk spin-down, and system sleep
- Disable screen saver
- Disable Time Machine
- Disable software update
- Disable dashboard (Catalina and prior)
- Disable photos processing and Cloud services
