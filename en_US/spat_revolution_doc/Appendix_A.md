## Hardware Recommendations and requirements 
 
#### Single Computer (Creative Station with DAW and SPAT Revolution) 

Single computer systems can provide a great option for portability but come with the importance of having a performing computer. As SPAT Revolution comes with a 3D graphic engine where audio objects are manipulated, GPU resources are required. 

**Base system/Portable; **

* Processing: Intel Core i9-9900K, i7-9700K or equivalent. Intel 8th generation or greater processor. (Minimum 6 cores - 8 preferred), 8 MB Cache.
* System Memory: 16 minimum GB DDR4 (32 preferred when integrating with DAW and SPAT Revolution on the same machine with local audio path—LAP) 
* Chipset: High-quality/Professional mainboard such as Intel® Z370 Chipset
* Graphic: GeForce GTX 1060 — 4 GB GDDR5 Graphic Memory or greater (Graphic card fully supporting OpenGL 2.0 is required. USB displays are not supported).
* Audio Interfaces: Mac OS X: Core Audio compatible interface or virtual sound cards, Windows: ASIO compatible interface or virtual sound cards. Preferred interfaces: USB 3 Audio interface. 
* OS: macOS High Sierra, Mojave or Catalina. Windows Pro 10 64 bits.
 
>  Mac OS X: OpenGL 2.0 required 
> 
>  Windows: If your computer has an ATi or Nvidia graphics card, please assure the latest graphic drivers from the ATi or Nvidia website are installed.

#### Hardware for live productions (Dedicated SPAT Revolution Computer)**
 
**Recommended audio interfaces:**

* Dante PCIe interfaces from Yamaha, Focusrite, or any Dante PCIe high-density card.
* RME Digiface AVB, USB 3 audio interface
* RME Madi HDSPe MADI FX or MADIface XT. 

**Recommended SPAT workstation system:**

* Intel® Xeon® W family W-2200 or W-3200 Series CPU (preferred), E-22xx, or equivalent. Higher core speed. Minimum 8 cores, 12 MB Cache
* Chipset: Professional workstation chipset C422, C621, or equivalent. 
* System Memory: 32–64 GB. A system with ECC support preferred.
* Graphic: Professional NVIDIA Quadro P4000 or equivalent — 8 GB GDDR5 Graphic Memory (graphic card with full support for OpenGL 2.0) 
* Network: Dual network interface (NIC)—Intel I210-T1 or equivalent 
* OS drive (Operating System): NVMe Internal SSD
* Audio Projects Hard Drive: No specifics. For redundant systems, only certified RAID systems should be used.
* OS: macOS High Sierra, Mojave or Catalina. Windows Pro 10 64 bits. Real time optimized OS.
