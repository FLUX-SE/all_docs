# 8.6 Room Response Parameters

![](include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_-154.jpg)

_Early_ refers to _Early Reflections_ stage of the Room response which is one of the
most significant stages involved in our rapid aural perception of spatial properties
and sound source localisation.

_Cluster_ refers to a secondary iteration of room response
reflections and is quite significant in the cognition of room acoustics.

_Tail_ refers to the diffuse reverberations that eventually decay in a direct relationship
with the size and reflectivity of an acoustic space. The tail section of a reverb dœs
not contribute much to the localisability of a sound source in a space, but instead
gives a sense of depth and ambience.

**Early Min**

Early reflections minimum time, i.e. the time at which the early reflections start to
appear, in milliseconds. This is the analogous of the ubiquitous “pre-delay” setting
found on most reverberation processors. It represent the time between the direct
sound and the first early reflection.

**Early Max**

Early reflections maximum time, i.e. the time at which these cease to appear.


**Early Dist**

Early reflections distribution. Determines the way early reflections are scattered in
time, inside the Early Min. / Early Max. interval. The default setting of 0.5 corresponds to regularly spaced reflections, above these are more grouped towards the
Early Max. value, and vice-versa.

**Early Shape**

Governs the amplitude rise or fall of early reflections. The default setting of 0.5 corresponds to early reflections all having the same level. This mimics an acoustical
space where reflective surfaces are all located at roughly the same distance to the
listener. Below 0.5 early reflections decay with time, above 0.5 they rise with time.
Early reflections of decreasing level would be typical of a space where most of the
reflective surfaces are grouped at a range closest to the listener.

**Cluster Min**

See Early Min. Please keep in mind the cluster is fed with the input of the early reflections processor section, as is shown accordingly on the display.

**Cluster Max**

See Early Max.

**Cluster Distribution**
