First of all, thank you for acquiring _SPAT Revolution_. 
We hope it will provide you with new levels of productivity, creativity and experience in sound design. 
Our goal was to deliver the most comprehensive real-time spatial audio renderer ever designed, and to make the whole process of spatialized audio production powerful and intuitive for beginners and professionals alike. 
Our real-time audio environment provides easy access to some of the most advanced spatialisation algorithms currently available, at the very best sound quality currently possible.

_'SPAT'_ is short for _Spatialisateur_ in French. 
It is a real-time audio library that allows composers, sound artists, performers and sound engineers to control the localisation of sound sources in virtual and real 3D auditory spaces.

_SPAT Revolution_ wraps the 'Spat' processing library in a luxurious and characteristic graphic environment to help visualise many aspects of a spatial audio composition in realtime. 
This graphic interface allows sound mixes to be composed as interactive spatial models existing in _Virtual Room_. 
SPAT contains a powerful multichannel reverberation engine which can be applied to design and add a sense of auditory space in studio mixes and realtime on location.
