# SPAT Environment

This section will go through the SPAT Revolution software environment in more detail. We will step through each of the main Graphic Editor views.

**Rendering to Speakers**

In order for the virtual scene to translate correctly as an immersive sound experience in a speaker format, SPAT needs to have an accurate model of a _multichannel speaker arrangement_ which will be used to map the multichannel information to the destination speakers and render the sound field correctly in a real space.
To this end, you will find a large library of standard and specialized speaker arrangements already built into SPAT which can be used in various places throughout the **Environment Setup**.

Speaker configurations can be used to fit the format of a virtual room to match the actual speaker system being used to diffuse the mix in a real room.
Channel based speaker configurations can also be used to transcode the format of a virtual source into a virtual room.
More about this later.

The golden rule when working with multi-channel based audio is that you must be sure to choose _exactly_ the right formats, speaker arrangements and channel routing throughout; otherwise the virtual space will not map correctly into a physical space.

**Virtual and Real Diffusion**

Successful diffusion of a sound field in space relies on every loudspeaker being assigned correctly to each software rendered output channels.

A diffusion system could range from a simple pair of headphones to a 16 (Essential) or 64 (Ultimate) speakers array and anything in between.
In some of the more virtualized workflows of SPAT Revolution, you may even be thinking about diffusion in a virtual space on configurations of virtual speaker arrangements and channel based formats.
The same rule for successful diffusion applies hereâ€”the diffusion in the virtual room will be compromised and sound off if the channel assignments to the virtual systems are incorrect.

In the above illustration, a virtual 5.1 and a virtual Cube arrangement exist together in a High Order Ambisonic Room, which may eventually be rendered to some other channel based end format.
