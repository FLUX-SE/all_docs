# 8.3 Preset Memories

Each parameter has the possibility to store useful preset settings of your own choosing. 
Right click on a parameter dial, and a contextual menu will pop up. 
From there you can store the current setting to a Memory Slot, or Recall a setting from a previously saved memory slot.
