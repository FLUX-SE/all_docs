# 9. Source Parameters

Every virtual Source in a Room has its own set of variable parameters which define
its simulated positional information, psycho acoustic properties, virtual acoustic
properties and other options.

To edit the variables of a source in the _Source Parameter_ editor, you must first be
inside a Room. Select the source you want to edit from the list on the left side panel
of the Room editor by left clicking on its Index number. Alternatively, grab its 'emitter' object in the 3D Room visualisation ( or just one of them, if the source is a multichannel group). When you select a source, the _Source Parameter_ editor will pop
up as a set of categorised groups with which you can alter the properties of the Virtual Source in the Room.

Additionally, a _right click_ on a Source Index number will bring up some further
options, especially useful is the **Colour** option, which allows you to set an identification colour to a Source or Group.
