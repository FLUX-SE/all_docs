# Transaural

Although we said earlier that Binaurally encoded files are not compatible with stereo loud speaker systems, it turns out that in _Spat Revolution_ there is a way to play binaurally encoded signals on loud speakers if necessary. You can do this by transcoding a binaural stream into a Transaural stream either at the _Input Transcoder_ stage of the **Environment Setup** graph or at the _Master Transcoder_ stage.

The term _Transaural_ refers only to the transcoding of binaural signals into loudspeaker-compatible signals. The reproduction mode is also known as "cross-talk cancellation" as it uses this very process to establish the loudspeaker-compatible signals.


!> To successfully achieve cross-talk cancellation, it is assumed that the listener _will be placed at a particular position with respect to the loudspeaker pair, or the spatial information will not be properly perceived._

An optimum listening position such as that needed for Transaural decoding, is also known as ' **the sweet spot** '. It is a fundamental concept to be aware of as we move into the next section: _Channel Based_ streams and panning algorithms.
