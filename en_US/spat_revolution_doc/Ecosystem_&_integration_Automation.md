# Ecosystem & integration

Almost all _SPAT Revolution_ parameters can be continuously controlled in real time using SPAT's high resolution _automated control_ features.

Control data can be sent via _Open Sound Control_ (**OSC**) or through multiple _SPAT Revolution_ plug-ins in your **DAW**. 
Parameter control can be played back from precomposed timelines, or performed, generated and captured in a variety of ways. 
One of the most straightforward ways is to set DAW automation on Write mode on a track that contains a SPAT Send plug-in, and use the graphical interface of the SPAT Room Editor to drag Virtual Sources around or turn source parameter pots. 
The movements will be captured into the DAW timeline in precisely the same way you would capture automation from a conventional DAW plug-in, like [Reaper](Third_Party_Cockos_Reaper.md), [Reavolution](Third_Party_ReaVolution.md), [ProTools](Third_Party_ProTools.md), [Nuendo](Third_Party_AbletonLive.md), [Ableton Live](Third_Party_Nuendo.md), [Bitwig](Third_Party_Bitwig_Studio.md), or other.

Alternatively, a wireless OSC control surface could be used to control the parameters of _SPAT Revolution_ in real time, whilst you stand in the middle of the sound system away from the computer.
There is already fully programmed remote for _SPAT Revolution_:
- the [SPAT Revolution REMOTE](ThirdParty_SPATRevolution_Remote) can be used on any device as a web-based controller.
- the legacy and discontinued _Lemur_ template for _SPAT Revolution_ (see [Third party integration" - Lemur](ThirdParty_Tablet_Remote.md)).

If you are using _Figure53 Qlab_ for show control, spatial effects can be sent along with the rest of the audio-visual cues for a big show or event (see ["Third party integration" - QLab](Third_Party_Figure53_QLab.md)).

If you are working with algorithmic gesture generators and modulators then your control signals can be easily sent into the SPAT Renderer via OSC to distribute and control spatial sound sources in real time using your own control programs.
