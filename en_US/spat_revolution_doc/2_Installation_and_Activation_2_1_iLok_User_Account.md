# 2.1 iLok User Account

_FLUX::_ uses the iLok license management system to deliver software licenses to users.
If you donâ€™t have an iLok account yet, then please create a free iLok account at [http://www.ilok.com](http://www.ilok.com) and download the iLok license manager.

A _FLUX::_ SPAT Revolution license come with two activations that need to be linked to your user account. 
Having two activations gives you the possibility of having a fixed license on one particular machine and a portable license on an iLok USB key if you own one, or a Main and Back up Spat Engine running on a live show.


> To Activate Licenses:
> - An iLok user account is required
> - An iLok USB key is optional
