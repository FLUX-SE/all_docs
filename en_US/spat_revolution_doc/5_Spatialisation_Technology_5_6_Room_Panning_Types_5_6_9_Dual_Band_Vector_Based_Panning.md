# 5.6.9 Dual Band Vector Based Panning (VBP Dual-Band)


Both Intensity and Amplitude Vector Based panning has a frequency range 

* Localization of low frequencies are better with Amplitude Panning.
* Localisation of high frequencies are better with Intensity Panning.

A hybrid approach of vector based panning has been developed in this way: the Dual Band Vector Based Panning.
This panning type merges the two approaches in order to combine the best of both worlds and to reach a better localization.
Amplitude panning is applied below the crossover frequency, intensity above.
The crossover frequency has been defined to 700Hz.

The dependencies mentioned in the VBAP section also apply to Dual Band Vector Based Panning.
