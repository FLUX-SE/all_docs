# 9.9 Spreading

![](../include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_-178.jpg)

**Spread Factor**

Spreading is a percentage factor that defines how a sound source will appear to
spread out across speakers or virtual speakers. It is similar to _Aperture_ in its focussing effect but will translate differently across certain channel based speaker
arrangements according to how many speakers are involved.

**Nearest Neighbours**

This parameter is only available to a source, if the room it is simulated in has been
specified to be using the _K Nearest Neighbour_ panning type (see section 5.64). It
sets a maximum limit to the number of speakers that the algorithm can use as
neighbours in its search for speakers to activate in relation to a virtual source. On a
10 speaker setup, 1-10 % will be the closest speaker to source. 11%-20% will be 2
and so forth.
