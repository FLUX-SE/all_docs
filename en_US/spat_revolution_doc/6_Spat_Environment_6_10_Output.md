# 6.10 Output

The main thing to note at the output stage, is that you can have any number of
output routes. Like the Inputs (see section 6.4) they may be either direct hardware
routes, which returns audio streams (via Matrix routing) to the physical outputs of
an audio interface connected to your Spat Revolution workstation. The Hardware
Output workflow is the most direct way to render in realtime to an actual loudspeaker system (or headphones).

Outputs may also be linked to Spat Revolution RETURN plug-ins, which returns audio streams internally on the same workstation to a valid Spat RETURN plug hosted
in your DAW. The software RETURN workflow offers an easy way to render the spatial scene to disk, as _Ambisonic encoded_ , _Binaural encoded_ or _Sound system encoded_ multichannel audio.

the same time as sound system specific rendering
