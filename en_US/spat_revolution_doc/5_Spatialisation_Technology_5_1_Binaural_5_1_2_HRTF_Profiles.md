# 5.1.2 HRTF Profiles

The included HRTF profiles in Spat Revolution are taken from a number of large
scale laboratory research projects where measurements were taken on many individuals\*. The chances are that one person's ears may sound more natural to you
than others. For a quick way to monitor binaural, you should try to find a profile that
you feel most comfortable with when monitoring your virtual scene on headphones. If you are providing a 3D in-ear monitor mix for a performer or a visitor to
an installation, try to find an HRTF that suits them best. This can be fun. If you are
not comfortable with listening through someone else ears - which is understandable - you could look into creating a personalised HRTF from your own head and
upper torso measurements. There already exist a number of services that can create HRTF profiles taken from laboratory measurements. If you decide to do this, for
yourself or someone else, then you can add the personalised profile to the list in
the HRTF Manager. In fact you can import any HRTF in SOFA format to the Spat
Revolution binaural encoding list, making Spat Revolution a very flexible solution
for binaural monitoring and rendering.

!> _An imported HRTF profile should be in SOFA format and should match the sample rate for your project. 
It is preferable to use a "SimpleFreeFieldSOS" IIR type of HRTF_

\* The profiles come from the "LISTEN" , "CROSSMOD" and "BiLi" databases.
