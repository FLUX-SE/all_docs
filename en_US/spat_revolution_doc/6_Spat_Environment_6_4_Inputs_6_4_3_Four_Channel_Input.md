# Four Channel Input

The next significant channel count that needs disambiguation from the user, is a
four channel stream.

![](../include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_-082.jpg)

A four channel stream could contain the format of a four speaker Channel Based
formats ( QUAD , 4.0 , LCRS ) but could also contain different formats of interleaved
four channel Ambisonic audio (A-Format, B-Format). You can read more about AFormat and B-Format in the **_WORKING WITH AMBISONICS_** section of this user
guide. The important thing to remember here is that confusing Ambisonic audio
and Channel Based audio is a significant mistake, even though you might hear
something 'wide sounding'.


!> Do not confuse multi-channel based audio formats with multi-channel Ambisonic audio formats. 
They may have the same channel counts but are completely different!
