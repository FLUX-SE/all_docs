# Mono Input

A one channel audio stream is always treated as a Mono signal. It will appear in a
_Virtual Room_ as one positionable virtual source with its own directivity and parameters. In many ways, Mono signals are the most straight forward format to work with
in a spatial composition. This is because a one channel signal discretely contains all
its acoustic and spectral properties without inter-channel dependencies, such as
those found in a wide stereo image for example. In practice, such point sources are
easier to localise and balance spatially with others.
