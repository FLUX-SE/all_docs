Epure is a state-of-the-art five-band equalizer designed to provide the absolute finest audio quality within the
domain of digital audio processing. Built with our proprietary State-Space technology, carefully tuned to preserve
the optimal signal to noise ratio independent of the parameter settings preventing the signal from deteriorating
when the gain is reduced, makes Epure a powerful go-to processor for your day-to-day session work, as well as
an efficient sharp-edged surgical precision tool for the most demanding equalizing and filtering tasks conceivable.

In addition to the supreme audio quality, the logical and comprehensive user interface includes a variety of instant
shortcut functions provided to enhance and simplify the user workflow, allowing for instant and precise operation.

## Bypass (1)
When pressed the inputs are routed direct to the outputs.

Default Value: Off

## Graphic Display (2)

Graphical editing provided by grabbing the curves on the graphical display.

## Band Activation (3)
Toggles the activation of the processing for the actual band.

Default Value: On

## Filter Type (4)
All mentioned filter types are available on all of the five bands.

Default Value: Peak

Additional Filter Types:

- 12 dB per octave high pass filter (Low Cut)
- Low shelving (Low Shlv)
- Parametric (Peak)
- High shelving (High Shlv)
- 12 dB per octave low pass filter (High Cut)

## Band Gain (5)
Adjusts the gain for the selected band.

Unit: dB  
Value Range: -24 / +  
Step: 0.  
Default Value: 0 dB

## Band Frequency (6)
Adjusts the center frequency for the band.

Unit: Hz  
Value Range: 5 / 22k  
Default Value: 50 / 200 / 500 / 2000  
Step: Variable  

## Band Q-Factor (7)
Adjusts the frequency range affected by Gain and Frequency on the band when the Parametric filter type is used.

With a lower Q-Factor, a wider range of frequencies are affected, with a higher Q-Factor, a narrower range of frequencies 
are affected. The narrowest Q-Factor is 1/7 octave of 100 in displayed value and the widest is 6.67 octave.
The effective Q-Factor depends on the amount of gain applied; the displayed value corresponds to the maximum
gain variation (24 dB).

> Example: With 6 dB gain the max Q-Factor is not 100 as displayed, but instead 10 in a regular expression to the
actual Q-Factor.

Value Range: 1 / 100  
Step: 0.  
Default Value: 10

## Preset Manager (8)
Opens a new window accessing the built-in preset manager.

## Save (9)
Saves the current parameter settings as a preset.

## Recall (10)
Populates all the parameters in the actual parameter section with the values from the selected preset.

## Copy A / Copy B (11)
Populates all the parameters in the actual parameter section with the values from the other section.
This also moves the Morphing Slider to the actual parameter section.

## Morphing Slider (12)
The Morphing Slider has no unity or specific value display, it provides morphing of the current values from both of
the parameter sections (A & B). A double-click on one side of the slider area toggles between the two parameter
sections. The actual result of the morphed parameter settings can be saved as a new preset.
