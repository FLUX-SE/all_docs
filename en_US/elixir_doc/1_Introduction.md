# Introduction

Elixir is the improved and revamp version of the legacy Elixir.
Such as it, Elixir is a novel kind of program limiter carefully designed to accomplish a truly natural sounding result without changing the nature of the audio material and its timbre, presenting none, or effectively reduced, conventional limiting “pumping” effects even during heavy processing.
Now supporting up to 32 channels, 64bits float audio processing and conforming with the ITU-R and EBU loudness norms, Elixir Essential is an indispensable tool for immersive audio productions.

It’s a REAL True Peak Limiter, providing a guaranteed True Peak output level according to the ITU-R-BS 1770 or the ITU-R-BS 1770-3, and EBU R128 norms.
The algorithm is using an oversampled representation of the audio sample as a reference when it defines the gain envelope; still, the processing is only applied to the original none oversampled data in order to reduce artifacts (like aliasing), and to achieve the most excellent sounding result.

Working on 64bits audio processing when the Digital Audio Workstation supports it, Elixir is incredibly easy to achieve great results with: set the input level, adjust ‘Threshold’ according to the amount of limiting you want, and finally enable ‘Make Up’ to compensate the gain and to add loudness - That’s it!
There is no need to care about release time or any other conventional limiter settings!

There’s an additional feature provided to increase the processing quality in Elixir called ‘Stages’.
Stages present the option to set the algorithm to perform the limiting processing in multi-stages, for a limitation more natural and more respectful of the sound material. 

# Elixir Session, Elixir Essential

Elixir comes with two different licensing options:
- Elixir *Session* supports up to 2 channels and a sample rate up to 96kHz.
- Elixir *Essential* supports up to 32 channels and a sample rate up to 384kHz

The build is the same for both Session and Essential versions, the licensing allowing to use the plug-in as Elixir Session or Essential.
