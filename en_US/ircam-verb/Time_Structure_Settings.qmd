## (35) Early shape
Governs  the  amplitude  rise or fall of early reflections. The default  setting  of  0.5  corresponds to early reflections all 
having  the  same  level.  This mimics  an  acoustical  space where reflective surfaces are all located at roughly the 
same distance to the listener.  
Below 0.5 early reflections decay with time, above 0.5 they rise with time. Early reflections of  decreasing  level  would  be 
typical of a space where most of  the  reflective  surfaces  are grouped at a range closest to the listener.

## (36) Early Min
Early reflections minimum time, i.e. the time at which the early reflections start to appear, in milliseconds. This is the 
analogous of the ubiquitous "pre-delay" setting found on most reverberation processors. It represent the time between 
the direct sound and the first early reflection.

## (37) Early Max
Early reflections maximum time, i.e. the time at which these cease to appear.

## (38) Early Distribution
Early reflections distribution. Determines the way early reflections are scattered in time, inside the Early Min. / Early Max. 
interval. The default setting of 0.5 corresponds to regularly spaced reflections, above these are more grouped towards the 
Early Max. value, and vice-versa.

## (39) Cluster Min
Cluster minimum time. See Early Min.  
> Please keep in mind the cluster is fed with the input of the early reflections processor section, as is shown accordingly on 
the display.

## (40) Cluster Max
Cluster maximum time. See Early Max.

## (41) Cluster Distribution
Cluster distribution. See Early Distribution.
