## (42) Input Gain
Adjusts the level of the signal fed to the plug-in, in dB increments.

## (43) Input level meter
Shows the current level of the input signal after applying input gain, in dB FS (deciBel Full Scale).

## (44) Output Gain
Used to trim the output signal and possibly avoid any overloading of the signal in the rest of the signal-chain.

## (45) Output level meter
Shows the current level of the input signal after applying output gain, in dB FS(deciBel Full Scale).

## (46) Dry/Wet
When used as insert effect, one can dial the right amount of "wet", reverberated signal with respect to the "dry", untreated 
input signal.  
The default 100-percent wet setting is mostly intended for the typical and preferred use in a send-effect configuration.

## (47) Setup
Toggles the display of the routing matrix, where the user can adjust the routing between input channels and virtual sources.

## (48) Setting
Gives access to a sub-menu where you can either select the I/O configuration, namely the input channel count followed by 
the output channel count, for hosts that support dynamic I/O configuration or display the credits page.  
The exact I/O combinations available depend on your actual audio hardware and host configuration.

## (49) Day - Night
Toggles between two interface schemes, which, as the name implies, are best suited to high or low light environments 
respectively. In a dimly-lit studio environment, switching to the nigthtime scheme with its darker color palette and lower 
contrast will minimize eye-fatigue when doing long sessions.
