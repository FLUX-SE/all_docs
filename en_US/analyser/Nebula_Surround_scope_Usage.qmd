# Usage
The Nebula | Surround scope displays a representation of how a surround signal's various components are distributed in a surround environment. 
The inner region displays the location of the signal frequency components in the selected surround configuration, while the outer ring shows the phase-correlation between channels.

Phase correlation between adjacent channels is shown as white section with a length proportional to the correlation. 
Additionally, L-R phase correlation is displayed on the top portion of the ring, and L-C and C-R inter-channel phase correlations are displayed just above the top of the ring.

Physical locations of the speakers for the selected configuration are marked on the ring itself for reference.
