# The Side Chain EQ Section

The band selection can be done with the 1, 2, 3 switches or directly from the graphic display.  All band parameters 
can also be set using switches and knobs or from the EQ-Curve graphic display as described below.  A Double-click

a Right-Click on this area, the behaviour of the vertical scale can be selected with: Auto, 6 dB, 12 dB and 24 dB as 
available choices.
