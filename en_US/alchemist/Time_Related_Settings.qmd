# Time Related Settings


## Delay (47)

Unit: ms  
Value Range: 0 to 50.0 ms  
Default Value: 0 ms

A delay reflecting the attack time can be introduced into the signal path in order to produce a zero attack time for
the dynamic processing. Shifting the delay value from the attack time allows to control transients. A delay value
inferior to the attack value lets peaks untouched by the processing.

> Note that the different delay values of every band are automatically compensated. Solera can’t be used to produce
delay based special effects.

!> Warning: Morphing between presets with different delay values produces sound artefacts.
Of course this delay introduces latency in the processing.


## Auto Delay (48)
Default Value: Off

When enabled, the delay value is linked to the attack value. Be aware that the latency introduced by this function is
now equal to your attack time dived by 2.


## Mode (49)
Default Value: Solera

8 different detection modes are available:
- Solera: The Attack setting also controls the integration time for RMS detection. When “Auto” is engaged for the
delay value, the produced attack time is zero.
- Solera Feed Backward: The Attack setting also controls the integration time for RMS detection which is done on
the output of the processor. This mode disables the Delay feature. Note also that the Solera Feed Backward prevents
to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain.
- Classic Fast: The integration time for RMS detection is 10 ms with no direct relation with the Attack setting. But
when “Auto” is engaged for the delay value, the produced attack time is zero.
- Classic Medium: The integration time for RMS detection is 40 ms with no direct relation with the Attack setting.
But when “Auto” is engaged for the delay value, the produced attack time is zero.
- Classic Slow: The integration time for RMS detection is 80 ms with no direct relation with the Attack setting. But
when “Auto” is engaged for the delay value, the produced attack time is zero.
- Classic Feed Backward Fast: The integration time is 10 ms for RMS detection which is done on the output of the
processor. This mode disables the Delay feature. Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external
side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain.
- Classic Feed Backward Medium: The integration time is 40 ms for RMS detection which is done on the output
of the processor. Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the
processed signal which feed the side chain.
- Classic Feed Backward Slow: The integration time is 80 ms for RMS detection which is done on the output of the
processor. Note also that the Feed Backward mode prevents to use the external side chain because it’s the processed signal which feed the side chain.


These Feed Backward modes have been inspired by vintage hardware architectures. they create a sort of auto regulation of the processing which produces a naturally beefy sound.


## Attack (50)

Unit: ms  
Value Range: 0 ms to 100 ms  
Default Value: 0.0 ms

Sets the attack time of the processing envelop. It also controls the manner the RMS value is computed from the
incoming signal.

!> Warning : The Attack setting also controls the integration time for RMS detection.


## Hold (51)

Unit: ms  
Value Range: 0 ms / 500 ms.  
Default Value: 0 ms

This parameter is the only one in the time related settings, that is independent per dynamic processor. The compressor and the expander may have different hold time.

Used in the Expander section, this setting allows very precise gating of drum tracks. It can also be used for creative
purpose on the other dynamic sections.


## Release Mode (52)
Default Value: Auto

Three release modes are available for the envelop of the dynamic processing.
- Manual corresponds to the value you have set.
- Auto enables our specific algorithm to generate a signal dependent value to avoid typical pumping effects.
- Advanced gives access to two different values for release and to the control of the velocity of the variations between the maximum and the minimum release values.


## Release (53)

Unit: ms  
Value Range: 0.67 ms / 10000.00 ms  
Default Value: 500.00 ms

Sets the manual release value and the maximum release value when in Advanced Mode.


## Release Minimum (54)

Unit: ms  
Value Range: 0.67ms / 5000.00  
Step: 0.01  
Default Value: 1.30 ms

Sets the minimum release value when in Advanced Mode.


## Dynamic Factor (55)

Unit: x  
Value Range: 0 / 3.0  
Step: variable.  
Default Value: 1

Amplify or dim the extracted real time dynamic informations.

## Dynamic Velocity (56)

Unit: %  
Value Range: 10 / 1000  
Step: 1  
Default Value: 50%

Sets the speed of variation on the dynamic informations.
