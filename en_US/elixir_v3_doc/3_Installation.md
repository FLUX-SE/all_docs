# Installation

First of all, make sure you have the latest version of the installer.

To download the latest installer, please go to:  
http://www.flux.audio/download/

From this page you will be able access the user download section by entering either your registered email address
or your product reference.

Your product reference is the serial number of your Flux:: dongle (the serial number can be found using the Security
Manager, see the “Authorization” section below), or your iLok.com user id if you use the iLok dongle for authorization.

When logged in to the user download section, download the latest installer according to your operating system, run
the installer, and you should be up to date in a few minutes only.
