# Signal types {#sec-signal-generator-types}

## Pink noise
Pink noise is a random signal with an amplitude falloff inversely proportional to frequency.
This is the most commonly employed variety noise in audio measurement, as it a constant-energy perceived content.

## White noise
White noise is a random signal with constant energy across the audio range.
Compared to pink noise, it sounds much brighter as it has more energy in high-frequencies.
Commonly employed for electronic apparatus measurements.

## Sine
Fixed-frequency, pure tone generator.

## Sweep
Generates a variable tone from start to end frequencies.
Linear and logarithmic variants are available.
Log. sweep is best suited for audio measurements as this corresponds to constant time per octave.

### Type
![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/Analyzer/SignalGenerator/NoiseType.png)

Sets the signal type to generate.

### Level
Output level of the waveform, expressed in dB RMS.

### Enable
Toggles signal generator output on and off.

## Setup
![Signal generator setup options.](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/Analyzer/SignalGenerator/Setup.png)

### Output
Selects the hardware output(s) to which the signal generator should be routed.
Set to? None? to disable the signal generator output entirely.

#### Output 1
First generator output.

#### Output 2
Second generator output.

:::{.callout-note}
Both signals sent to the hardware output channels are identical.
:::

### Feed input reference
Fed the reference input (default input 1) with the signal generator. 

### Sine frequency
Sets the frequency of the sine generator, only applicable when the signal type is set to Sine.

### Sweep start/end frequencies

Sets the range of frequencies to sweep.

:::{.callout-note}
Reverse start and end frequencies to obtain reverse sweep.
:::

### Sweep length
Sets the overall duration of the sweep in seconds,<i>i.e.</i> the time taken to go from start to end frequency.

### Level
Generator output level in dB RMS.
