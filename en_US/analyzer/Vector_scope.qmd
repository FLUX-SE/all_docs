# Vector scope

## Usage
The vector scope tool is displayed when a stereo input is detected, otherwise the display will switch to [Surround scope -@sec-nebula-surround-scope-usage] provided if your edition of Pure Analyzer includes this option.

### Modes in Surround :

![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/Analyzer/VectorScope/SurroundModes.png)

**L-R**

Use only Left and Right Channels.

**Front**

Use a stereo down mix with all front channels.

**Rear**

Use a stereo down mix with all Rear channels.

**Stereo downmix**

Use a stereo down mix with all channels.

**Lt/Rt downmix**

Use a Lt/Rt down mix with all channels.

**LR-Lfe**

Use a mono summation of Left and Right + the Lfe (sub) channel.

**Center-Lfe**

Use Center + Lfe (sub) channel.

**Front-Lfe**

Use a mono summation of the front channels + the Lfe (sub) channel.

### Fs
![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/Analyzer/VectorScope/FS.png)

Over-sampling factor in multiples of FS, that is the incoming audio is up-sampled as necessary to reach this multiple times 48kHz.
Increasing this value increases the display precision and reactivity, at the expense of a little CPU overhead.

### Blending
Controls the amount of particle blending with the current image, from 1 to 100%. 
A higher value gives more priority to the incoming audio over past frames.

### Fading
Controls display persistence, <i>i.e.</i> the "fade to black" amount for a frame. 
Lowering this value retains past particles longer, whereas increasing this make them disappear faster.

### Size factor
Controls the size of individual particles with respect to screen size.

### Blur kernel size
Controls the radius of the blur effect applied to past particles.
Particles are "smeared" more and more as they become older, depending on this setting. 
Naturally, a bigger value increases the smearing, at the expense of processing power.

:::{.callout-note}
Choosing the value for this setting is really matter of taste, although please keep in mind values that above 5 will require a sufficiently powerful graphics card in order to  maintain a responsive display.

### Color mode
![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/Analyzer/VectorScope/ColorMode.png)

This defines how the particle color is determined:
* Static color: use only particle start color (see below)
* Power grading: color is modulated by overall signal RMS power
* Dynamic grading: color is modulated by signal dynamics
* Pw+Dyn grading: mix of the two previous modes

### Particle start/end colors
Sets the particle color range to be used.
