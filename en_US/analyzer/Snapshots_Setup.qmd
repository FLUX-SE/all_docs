## Name

You can here define a new project name which will ultimately create a new folder in the user data folder `<User folder>/FLUX SE/Pure Analyzer System/Data/<Project Name>`


## Display defaults
Toggles the default curve visibility applied to newly created snapshots.

'All' controls whether new snapshots should be visible by default, and you can fine-tune which curves should also be shown/hidden here.
