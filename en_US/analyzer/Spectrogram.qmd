# Spectrogram

## Usage

The spectrogram is a two-dimensional view of the evolution of the signal's spectrum over time, i.e. a frequency (Y-axis) versus time (X-axis) plot (or the invert, depending on the direction setting), with the magnitude modulating the color and intensity of the pixels.

A spectrogram can be computed using the STFT (short-term Fourier transform) as well as other means.
It serves as a useful tool to get a global picture of how the frequency content of a signal changes over a time, and eases identification of its structure.
Broadband noise appears as background, a pure tone as a horizontal line, and a transient as a vertical line.

Harmonic content appears as horizontal groups of parallel lines and vertical bars respectively, etc.

### Direction

Defines the scrolling direction of the spectrogram.

### Log Gain

Toggles logarithmic scaling of the magnitude spectrum on and off.

Default is on.

When enabled, the magnitude at a given time-frequency point is applied a logarithmic scaling before being converted to a pixel value.
This has the effect of compressing the dynamic range, and makes low energy components stand out more, but also decreases the contrast of the display.

### Threshold

#### Threshold  - Range Max

Sets the maximum amplitude spectrum value to be displayed.

#### Threshold - Range Min

Sets the minimum amplitude spectrum value to be displayed.

### Color Mode

#### Duotone

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a two-color palette, set using start/end colors.

#### Black On White

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a Black &amp; White color palette with White as background.

#### White On Black

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a Black &amp; White color palette with Black as background.

#### Power grading 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using different predefined color palette.

#### Frequency grading

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point determines the intensity of the corresponding pixel, whose color varies according to frequency.

#### Duo-tone grading start/end colors

Sets the color to use for minimum and maximum amplitude components respectively, when color mode is set to _Duotone_.
