Impulse response setup options

## Run
Toggles impulse response live update on and off. Default is on.
You can temporarily freeze the impulse response with this button, to examine it in detail at your leisure, without worrying about changing external conditions.

Disabling 'Run' is equivalent to freezing the measurement, and leaves the averaging buffer as is.

# Reset
Resets the impulse response computation, including the averaging buffer.

:::{.callout-note}
If you are using a lengthy averaging setting and have just changed your setup, you can reset the entire impulse response to immediately forget previous measurements .
