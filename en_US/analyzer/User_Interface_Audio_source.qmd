# Audio source
Audio source allows you to select which source to use as input. Depending on your current configuration and settings, this will include:

* Available SampleGrabber instance(s), either local or remote.
* Available hardware device(s), if one or several sound cards are present on the host system, and the corresponding device has been selected in the Hardware IO configuration dialog.
