# Metering statistics
The metering statistics view shows a synthetic view of the current and past meter values in numeric form.
It also serves to process multiple existing audio files in one pass, display and export the results to disk.

![Metering statistics display](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/MeteringStatistics/Main.png)

## Overview
The display shows the average and range for the various level meter values, since the start of the application or the last time the meter was reset, in a spread-sheet type view.

### Peak, TruePeak and RMS
Mean as well as overall minimum and maximum values are shown. 
For min. and max. values, the corresponding Timecode position is also indicated.

### Loudness
As EBU R128 Loudness already incorporates statistical computations, only the current values are shown.

## File export
Exports a report containing a summary of the metering statistics data to a text file.

Clicking the ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/Export.png) button brings up a standard file dialog where you can specify the desired file name for the dialog.

## Setup

### Absolute Timecode

Toggles between relative and absolute Timecode display. 
See [TimeCode](08_Metering_History_02_Setup.md?id=timecode) for more information.


## Incident Reporting

### Overview
All TruePeak and R128 Short term values that cross the thresholds are recorded and displayed as a list. 
Each row in the list shows a record of the offending peak value in dB alongside with the time-code at which the event occurred. 
You can navigate the list and locate the time positions of the incident, then playback again the corresponding source material in order to identify and correct the problem.

### Setup
![Incidents setup options.](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/MeteringStatistics/IncidentSetup.png)

#### Max. incident count

To avoid overloading the display, and eventually, the computer's memory, there is a limit placed on the number of registered incidents, which is 2000 by default. 
If you go above this, it might be a good idea to back off the master fader a bit anyway to let that music breathe !

However, you can override this behavior by setting this value to -1, which will remove the limit altogether.

#### TruePeak Incident Enable + threshold

Defines the threshold above which an incident will be registered. 
Default is 0dBTP, which corresponding to full digital scale. 
A conservative value would be -0.1dBTP, to be on the safe side.

Keep in mind TruePeak is designed to measure inter-sample peaks, and that 0dBTP is actually a few tenths of decibels softer than digital peak.

#### EBU R128 Short term / Dialog Incident Enable + thresholds

Defines the threshold under/above which an incident will be registered.

## Off-line Processing Media Queue

### Usage
Multiple audio files can be added to the list for unattended queue processing.

#### Principle
The media queue is intended for processing a soundtrack possibly split across several reels and channels. 
Reels are processed in the order in which they are added and in which they appear in the list.

#### Usage
Audio files are added by clicking the icon ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/Plus.png), which brings up a standard file selection dialog, where you can select as many files as you want, provided they all have the same channel count and in a supported format, with a recognized extension (.wav).
When you are ready, click the ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/Play.png) icon to start processing the list, which will be computed much faster than real-time, especially if you have a fast computer.

The results are displayed when ready in the main view, and you can export these to a file just as you would with metering statistics computed on incoming audio.

#### Reel grouping
If reels are split across several multichannel files, you can add all the files at once directly in the file selection dialog. 
Reel order corresponds to the order in which the files were added.

#### Channel grouping
If your source material consists of mono-tracks, you must add reels one-by-one, adding all files for the various channels of the current reel. 
Please ensure different reels have the same channel count or the software will report an error. 
Channel configuration and names are inferred from the file names using a fuzzy-logic algorithm that looks for the presence of typical marker characters such as C / Center for the center channel, R / Right for the right channel etc. (case insensitive).

If the automatic channel grouping does not succeed, an error message will be displayed. 
Please rename the offending file(s) according to one of the expected schemes above to correct the problem.

:::{.callout-note}
This function is not intended to process unrelated soundtracks in batch mode. 

Please repeat the operation as necessary if you wish to obtain separate results for individual tracks.
