# Preset
A number of presets covering widely and not so widely-used metering standards are provided.

![Available RMS metering presets](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FLUX-SE/doc_images/main/Analyzer/Metering/PresetsRMS.png)

## Custom
User defined values.

## Default
All-round settings with:

* From -48 to +18 dB range, referenced at -18dB.
* 160ms integration time, 16dB/s release, 1dB peak release and 60 frames peak hold.

## Ref -18dB A/B/C/K
Default settings with pre-equalization following either normalized ANSI A/B/C or ITU-R BS.1170-2 weighting curves, referenced to -18dB.

## Ref -20dB A/B/C/K
Default settings with pre-equalization following either normalized ANSI A/B/C or ITU-R BS.1170-2 weighting curves, referenced to -20dB.

## VU meter Standard
Standard reference VU settings, with 300ms integration, 66/7dB/s release and peak release times, referenced at 0VU/-4dBu/-18dBFS. 
The scale is non-linear and covers -20 to +3VU, complying with IEC 60268-17.

## K-System / VU
Linear scale, conforming to Bob Katz's recommendations, referenced at either -12, -14 or -20dB, 300ms integration, 66.7dB/s release and 12dB/s peak release times, 180 frames peak hold.

## K-System / Slow
Identical to K-System/VU, except that integration times are doubled. 
This reflects Bob Katz's view that Vu-meter timings are appropriate for speech, but that longer timings are better suited to music.

## DIN 45406
This preset conforms to the standard used many European broadcasters such as French (PAD) and German (IRT) television. 
Integration time is 10ms for a 90% signal increase; fall-back time is 1.7s per 20dB; with a linear scale covering a range from -50 to +5dB, referenced at -9dBFS. 
The corresponding standards are DIN 45406, IEC 60268-1, and ARD Pfl.H.3/6.

## Nordic N9
5ms integration time for an 80% increase, fall-back time 1.7s per 20dB, linear scale covering the range from -40 to +9dB, referenced at -18dBFS, according to IEC 60268-10/1 + N9 supp.

## BBC Normal
10ms integration time for an 80% increase, fall-back time 2.8s per 24dB, custom scale with graduations spaced apart by 4dB, and 4 stands for the -18dBFS reference, according to IEC 60268-10/2a.

## BBC Slow
Same as above except for ballistics, where the integration time is changed to 69.2ms for an 80% increase, and 3.8s per 24dB fall-back.

## EBU Normal
10ms integration time for an 80% increase, fall-back time 2.8s per 24dB, linear scale covering the range from -12 to +12dB, referenced at -18dBFS, according to IEC 60268-10/2b.

## EBU Slow
Same as above except for ballistics, where the integration time is changed to 69.2ms for an 80% increase, and 3.8s per 24dB fall-back.
