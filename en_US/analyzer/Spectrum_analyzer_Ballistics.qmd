# Ballistics
The curve display update speed is controlled by the ballistics settings.

## Release time

The release time determines how fast the main curve falls back to zero. Default is 300ms.

## Max release time

The controls the release time of the optional *Max* curve, which serves to display the medium-to-long term tendency of the magnitude spectrum. Longer times mean curve maxima/peaks will be seen for a longer period.

Default is 50 seconds.

> The attack time is zero so the curve displays reacts instantaneously to a rising amplitude.
