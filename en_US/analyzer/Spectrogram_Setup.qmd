## Direction

Defines the scrolling direction of the spectrogram.

## Log Gain

Toggles logarithmic scaling of the magnitude spectrum on and off.

Default is on.

When enabled, the magnitude at a given time-frequency point is applied a logarithmic scaling before being converted to a pixel value.
This has the effect of compressing the dynamic range, and makes low energy components stand out more, but also decreases the contrast of the display.

## Threshold

### Threshold  - Range Max

Sets the maximum amplitude spectrum value to be displayed.

### Threshold - Range Min

Sets the minimum amplitude spectrum value to be displayed.

## Color Mode

### Duotone

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a two-color palette, set using start/end colors.

### Black On White

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a Black &amp; White color palette with White as background.

### White On Black

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using a Black &amp; White color palette with Black as background.

### Power grading 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point is mapped to a pixel using different predefined color palette.

### Frequency grading

In this color mode, the amplitude of a time-frequency point determines the intensity of the corresponding pixel, whose color varies according to frequency.

### Duo-tone grading start/end colors

Sets the color to use for minimum and maximum amplitude components respectively, when color mode is set to _Duotone_.
