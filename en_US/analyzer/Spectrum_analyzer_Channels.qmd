# Channels
This group of settings controls the appearance of curves when channel sum mode is disabled. There is one Ch.<i>N</i> curve color setting per channel, so you can fine-tune the color scheme employed if you wish to do so.

# Filled
Controls whether channel curves are drawn as a solid color fill or a plain line.

# Opacity

Controls the opacity of the fill when <i>Filled</i>
is enabled. 100% gives a fully opaque fill, lowering this value makes the curve fill more transparent.

#Channel curve color
This setting controls the color of the curve corresponding to the n<super>th</super>channel, when summation mode is disabled.
