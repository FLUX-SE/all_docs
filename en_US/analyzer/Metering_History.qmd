# Metering History

## Usage {#sec-metering-history-usage}
The metering history panel stores and displays the evolution of meters over time, with a red vertical bar indicating current time. 
Start and end time-points of the period over which the history are displayed left and right in time-code format.

Selecting which meters are to be included in the display is done by clicking the corresponding buttons in the setup.

### Timecode offset
Clicking the ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/TCOffset.png) defines the current time as the Timecode offset.

### Timecode offset reset
Clicking the ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/ResetTCOffset.png) button resets the Timecode offset to zero.
Absolute and relative Timecode will then be the same.

### Play
Clicking the ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/Play.png) toggles history recording on and off.
Metering values are discarded when off.

:::{.callout-note}
The metering history relies on the same settings as those defined in the various meters. However, when multiple meter values are displayed simultaneously, the display range of the history is adapted so it encompasses the display ranges of the meters.

Keep in mind different meters can be set to different zero reference points when comparing meter history curves.

## Setup

:::{.callout-note}
Metering history setup options.
:::

### TimeCode

#### Absolute Timecode
Switches between absolute and relative Timecode formats.

#### Update Factor
Divides the History refresh interval; allowing to increase the
history time period.

### Single curve

#### Color
Sets the color to use when only a single curve is selected for display.

### Peak
These settings allow to specify whether Peak and/or TruePeak curves should be displayed, as well the color to use when drawing them.

### RMS
Toggle RMS curve display on and off, and specify the color to use for drawing.

### Dynamics
The dynamics is the current dynamic range of the signal, that is the ratio of the peaks with respect to the average, <i>i.e.</i>the crest factor of the signal.

#### Dynamics
Toggles dynamics curve display on and off.

#### Integration
Set the integration time, in milliseconds.

#### Color
Specify the color to use for drawing the curve.

:::{.callout-note}
Percussive content such as drums or rhythm guitar exhibit high dynamics, as opposed to sustained sounds such as strings and synthesizer pads.
:::

### Loudness
These settings allow to specify whether Short-term and/or Momentary EBU R128 Loudness curves should be displayed, as well the color to use when drawing them.
