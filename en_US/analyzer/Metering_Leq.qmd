# Leq Metering

## Introduction
Leq encompasses a set of sound level meter specifications, which are described in detail in the BS EN 61672-1 European Standard.

FLUX:: Analyzer implements the following Leq measurements: time-weighted sound level, time-average sound level and sound exposure level.

Frequency weighting is employed for all measurements, A being the standard and default, although other weightings can be specified if necessary.

The Leq module always measures the audio routed through the Mic channel.

### Time-weighted sound level
L<sub>A</sub>
is the root-mean-square sound level obtained after exponential time weighting.

Exponential averaging has the effect of progressively 'forgetting' past sample values.

The norm specifies two time-weighting constants:

* Fast : 125ms
* Slow: 1s

:::{.callout-note}
The corresponding letter symbol is L<sub>AF</sub> for an A-frequency weighted and F time-weighted sound level, for example.

### Time-average sound level
Time-average sound level is basically an RMS meter with frequency-weighting applied.

### Sound exposure level
This measures the sound exposure equivalent to a 'dose' received for a second. 

:::{.callout-note}
It is useful for determining the amount of sound pressure to which listeners have been exposed for a certain duration.

This value naturally increases with time. For a constant source level, this value increases in a logarithmic fashion.

### Zero ref.
Adjusts the reference point. See RMS for more information.

### Weighting
Frequency weighting employed. Can be switched between ANSI standard (A, B, C, D) and none. 
The default is A.

### Time-weighted F
Indicates the time-constant for the <i>Fast</i> time-weighted sound level.

### Time-weighted S
Indicates the time-constant for the <i>Slow</i> time-weighted sound level.

### Average integration
Sets the integration time for the time-average sound level, between 1s and 14400s (4 hours). Default is 10s.

### Main display
Switches the main measurement display from time-average sound level (the default) to sound exposure level.

## SPL

### SPL reference

This is the reference level of the calibrator's output, indicated on the device itself or in the corresponding datasheet. 
A typical value is -94dB.

### SPL trim

This is the offset applied to RMS dB values in order to obtain dB SPL readings. 
It is determined automatically by the calibration procedure.

### Calibrate

Press this button after having insert the microphone into the calibrator socket and activated it in order to determine the SPL trim value.
