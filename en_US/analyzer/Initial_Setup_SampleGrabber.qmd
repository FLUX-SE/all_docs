# SampleGrabber

## Principle of operation {#sec-intial-setup-samplegrabber}

The FLUX:: Analyzer app completely separates signal acquisition from analysis for maximum flexibility.

Source and response signals are first acquired by the SampleGrabber plugin and subsequently routed across the network using the ZeroConf/Apple Bonjour protocol. Finally, the FLUX:: Analyzer standalone application receives the sample feed(s) and analyzes them.

SampleGrabber is a surround-capable plugin, available in all common format (VST, AU, RTAS and TDM), whose channel configuration is set automatically, or by clicking the ![](https://flux-shared.s3.amazonaws.com/doc_images/Analyzer/Generic/Gear.png) icon and setting the desired channel count in the I/O sub-menu.

The FLUX:: Analyzer application displays in the [Audio source](02_User_Interface_02_Audio_source.md) menu a list of SampleGrabber instances found on the network . Each instance is identified by the associated computer network name it is running on. Clicking a name in the list selects the corresponding SampleGrabber for input.

You can insert up to 64 instances of SampleGrabber plugins inside one same DAW,
and up to 64 FLUX:: Analyzer instances can be connected to any SampleGrabber instance over the
network. A SampleGrabber can be connected to up to 64 FLUX:: Analyzer instances over the network. *We do however recommend to limit the number of instances in order to avoid saturating the network.*

## Network configuration

Network configuration is completely automatic and transparent, thanks to the use of the ZeroConf/Apple Bonjour protocol. Should you encounter any problems with your connection, we advise you to check whether the UDP port range from 46000 to 46064 is opened in your firewall, for both incoming and outgoing connections.

The audio transport requires approximately 1.4Mbps for each channel at a sample rate of 44.1kHz, whereas a 5.1 configuration at 96kHz demands a little less than 20Mbps. A properly functioning standard Ethernet 100Mbps network should therefore be more than sufficient to handle most scenarios.

The above bandwidth requirements naturally do not apply when using both SampleGrabber and FLUX:: Analyzer on the same machine.

Please check with your network administrator if you have any bandwidth issues and/or special requirements.

## Password

An optional password, which is a simple 4-digit number, allows you to apply light encryption to the audio stream for secure transmission over the network. It is set to 0 by default which disables encryption; in this case no additional action in the FLUX:: Analyzer application is required on your part.

If you wish to employ and define a password in SampleGrabber, please enter a matching value in the SampleGrabber menu of the FLUX:: Analyzer application in order to be able to decrypt the incoming stream.

Please note that the security level provided by this encryption is mild, and is only intended to protect from anyone eavesdropping your audio stream inside the internal network. It is not intended as a substitute for conventional network security practices and measures such as software and hardware firewalling, etc.
