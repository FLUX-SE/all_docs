Time averaging is on by default as the goal here is to provide the most stable display, and to eliminate any variations of the signal in time.

Frequency smoothing can be useful to smooth out irregularities and get a general picture of the curve.
It is advised to use this function sparingly though, as it can change values by a large proportion, and obscure potential problems with either the actual system being measured, or the measurement setup itself.

A combination of time averaging and frequency smoothing is most often required to obtain readable results in real-world scenarios, especially with large rooms and outdoors.
