# Coherence / magnitude

## Smoothing detail
Sets the amount of detail present on the smoothed magnitude and coherence curves. 
This number is roughly the maximum number of valleys and peaks that will remain after smoothing. 
A low value of around 10 is good for getting a global and uncluttered picture of a room's frequency response.

Relying on smoothed curves altogether should be avoided, as smoothing can mask-out essential information such as room modes, which materialize as sharp peaks and dips in the transfer function magnitude curve. 

We strongly recommend basing your judgment on both raw and smoothed curves even when the raw curve is very noisy.
