## The Ultimate Frequency Dependent Transient Designer

BitterSweet Pro, Frequency Dependent Transient Designer, is built around a new improved design of the algorithm found in Flux:: acclaimed freeware transient processor, BitterSweet, used by hundreds of thousands of users all over the world, and the approach we had when designing BitterSweet Pro was to make it just as easy and straightforward to use.

With BitterSweet Pro, Transients and Sustain can be amplified or attenuated simultaneously or individually, and it can process either all components (Main) in one, or process the Mid (Center) or the Side (Stereo) parts of the sound independently by encoding the material with its internal MS encoder, process it, and then decode it back to stereo again. This fundamental design makes it really easy to perform powerful level-independent transparent shaping of the sound spectrum with BitterSweet Pro.

## Frequency Dependent Transient Processing

In addition to this, BitterSweet Pro is designed with the option to process only a certain part of the frequency spectrum, turning the processing frequency dependent, acting just like a dynamic equalizer.

When Frequency Range is set from 20 Hz to 20 KHz the processing is performed on the full band, now changing the value of the low cut off frequency turns it into a High shelve dynamic eq, setting the high cut off frequency turns it into a Low shelve dynamic eq, and setting both turns it into a peak dynamic eq, in any case the gain can be adjusted with the Static Gain parameter, and the slope can be set with the Frequency Order parameter, from 6dB per octave to 12, 18 and 24 dB, the higher the Frequency Order is the steeper the slope of the frequency response becomes.

The detector sidechain is filtered in accordance with the frequency range setting and its low cut, high cut and band pass filter, and the filtered sidechain source can be audited with a simple button click.
