## Resulting Transfer Curve (35)
Auto Scale depending of the threshold value(s)


## Input Level Meter (36)
Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default, with auto scale depending of the threshold values.
When the MS Width section is engaged, the M (Middle) level is displayed on the left meter. S (Side) is displayed on
the right meter.

The green index reflects the threshold value.


## Output Level Meter (37)
Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default, with auto scale depending of the threshold values.
When the MS Width section is engaged, the M (Middle) level is displayed on the left meter. S (Side) is displayed on
the right meter.

## Resultant Envelop (38)
Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default. The scale is +/- 12 dB.  
This is the compression, decompression, expander and de-expander summing envelop.


## Dynamic difference between in and out (39)
Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default. The scale is +/- 12 dB.


## Level difference between in and out (40)
Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default. The scale is +/- 12 dB.  
This is the compression, decompression, expander and de-expander summing envelop which also takes account of
the input and output gains of the band.


## Dynamic Activity Display (41)
No scale  
The current L.I.D. Threshold value is reflected by two blue lines on the Dynamic Activity display.  
The L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (41) exceeds the area between the two blue
lines.


## Instant Release Value (42)
Auto Scale depending of the release value(s)
