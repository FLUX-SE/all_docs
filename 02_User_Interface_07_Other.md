# Hold info text
When this button is disengaged, textual information overlays displayed above curves are held
until the button is engaged again. This allows you to check a particular value precisely, such as an
amplitude, gain, or phase at a particular frequency determined by the mouse cursor position when the
switch was engaged. The most convenient to use this feature is to use the corresponding keyboard
shortcut (*F6*).

# Full-screen mode

(Windows) or Dock (MacOS) if desired.

# Close
Exits the application.

# Help / about
