# 1.2 About this Guide

This guide has been written for practitioners already working in immersive sound
production yet new to the Spat Revolution software environment. Is also intended
to be read as a practical introduction to surround and immersive audio production
for those who are new to the medium and coming to it through Spat Revolution. Of
course, there is plenty more knowledge to be had in the field of immersive audio
and the technology behind it, which will strengthen your understanding and decision making. We have included an appendix with some references for further reading about Ambisonics, Channel Based audio systems and acoustics for those who
are curious to find out more.

We strongly suggest spending an hour or two to read through this guide before
starting on your first major production and keep it on hand during the process. Expert support and advice can also be sought from the Flux Spat Revolution support
team and web-based knowledge base.

If you prefer a fast start introduction to the characteristics of the Spat Revolution
environment, certainly jump ahead to Section 6, 10 or 11.

But let us start now with a practical guide on getting the software installed and
running.
