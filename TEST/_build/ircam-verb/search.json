    "text": "The Verb is an algorithmic reverberation processor build in a modular way, with an recursive filtering based engine.\n\nThis block diagram view explain the basics of this engine, to explain the time structure of the reverberation tail:\n\nThe direct signal is pushed first. It represents the direct sound, aka. the sound that comes first to the listener.\nThen, follow a first generator of early reflexions, called here EARLY. Theses early reflexions are particularly important as they describe the immediate spatial environment around the sound source: walls, floor, roof. Theses reflexions are depending on the source position : they are panned in the space.\nA second delay generator follows the early stage, called CLUSTER. Theses early reflexions comes a bit later, and have seen their density increased in comparaison to the first early. They can be shown as a transition stage between the early and the late tail generator. In a standard configuration, theses reflexions are seen as a common part of all the space : they are not localized. You can make it directive using the diffuseness parameter.\nA final LATE TAIL stage, synthetize the reverb tail. Most of the time, acoustical description of this tail shows it as an dense and homogeneous material in the reverberated space (you can change that too with the same diffuseness parameter).\n\nUnderstanding this time structure, and the associated listening feeling is really important for an enhanced approach to any reverberation system.\nFor a first quick approach, you can:\n\nset the reverberation time with the main decay time\nset the room basics characteristic with the room size meta-parameter\nset some room filters, to adapt the tail to your current needs."

    "text": "3.1 (1) Decay time\nThis is the duration of the reverberation ‘tail’ in seconds, in other words how long it takes for the reverberated sound to vanish away. In more technical terms, this is sometimes referred to as the RT60 factor, which is the time at which the response of the reverberation to an input signal goes below -60dB of attenuation.\nPlease bear in mind that the master decay and high/mid/low controls are interactive, which means that the same audible result can be attained with different settings. This is intentional, as this allows you to get to the result faster and in a manner suited to your personal habits.\nGenerally speaking, it might be more convenient to adjust the master decay time using the resulting sound as a guideline, then fine tune using high and/or low decay controls and leave the mid decay at the default setting. On the other hand, if you specifically to concentrate on the mids, for example to create a ‘hollow room’ sound, it’s easier to focus on the mid decay control, leaving hi and mid decay untouched."

This behavior is quite typical of natural spaces, where high frequencies are easily absorbed (by furniture, carpet, etc…) before the lowest ones. Roughly speaking, for a given master decay time, increasing this ratio increases the sense of liveliness of the acoustic space, whereas decreasing it deadens it.\nThe correspondingly affected band frequencies are determined by the Crossover freq. high control setting."

A single global preset includes A and B section content and the morphing slider position.\nA Preset can directly be recalled into the preset section selected by the morphing slider position, by double-clicking on its name on the list. The preset lists can be filtered. This filter is applied to any preset information such as name, description, author, comments or key words.\n\n\n9.2.1 Recall A\nrecalls the selected preset into the corresponding section.\n\n\n9.2.2 Recall B\nrecalls the selected preset into the corresponding section.\n\n\n9.2.3 Copy A and Copy B\nbuttons allow to easily create a variation around a preset.\n\n\n9.2.4 Update\nallows to save the current settings for the selected preset.\n\n\n9.2.5 New\ncreates a new preset in the list.\n\n\n9.2.6 Duplicate\ncreates a new preset in the list from the selected one.\n\n\n9.2.7 Edit\ngives access to the specific windows which allows to change preset name, description, key words…..\n\n\n9.2.8 Delete\nsuppresses the selected preset.\n\n\n9.2.9 Export\ncreates a file reflecting the content of the preset bank.\n\n\n9.2.10 Import\nadds existing presets into the preset bank.\n\n\n9.2.11 Ordering arrows\norders the presets into the list.\n\nThe preset protection if engaged, allows only its original modification author to uncheck and edit.
