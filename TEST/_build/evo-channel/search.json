In EVO Channel an Arbitrary and Linear Phase Rotation throughout the spectrum is provided, to accomplish the same natural thing as when physically moving a microphone, of course without adding any latency.\n\nThe phase must be enabled for all the drum tracks. Then set the same group number for all these tracks. It allows to enable and disable the phase for all the drums in one click (simply switch on/off for the phase in one of the tracks).\n\n\n3.3.1 Phase Switch\nThe Phase is the result of Flux:: proprietary research, this unique algorithm allows linear phase correction with zero latency.\nActivate the phase module on all of the tracks that were recorded at the same time and in the same room (multi- microphones tracking or live recording in exemple), and then use the slider on the different tracks until you get full control over the phase and everything sounds correct.\nWhen enabled, the phase correction is turned on.\nValue Range : Enabled/Disabled\nDefault Value : Disabled\n\n\n3.3.2 Phase Group\nAdd an EVO Channel instance to a Phase Group.

The compressor and the expander may have different hold time.\n\nUsed in the Expander section, this setting allows very precise gating of drum tracks.

To start understanding this setting and easily hear it, take a full mixed drum kit or a complete mix with punchy drums, set the compression threshold, ratio to get something near pumping or an aggressive compression.\nThen increase the output gain to compensate the gain lost and then toggle between 0 and 100% of Dynamic Ratio. At 100 % you should hear more air in the sound, more transient and less compression impression; especially in terms of attack.\n\n\n4.1.11 L.I.D.. (Level Independent Detector) (32)\nUnit: %\nValue Range: 0 / 100\nStep: 1\nDefault Value: 0 %\nAllows process the audio signal independently of the sound level but regarding the signal dynamic range. It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Solera or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content. How can this be used? When you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound ™pumping∫ when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etcº ) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumpingº In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients.\n\n\n\n4.1.12 L.I.D.. Threshold (33)\nSets the gain range of the L.I.D. parameter.\n\nUp: Increasing of the L.I.D. action\nDown: Decreasing of the L.I.D. action\n\nThe current L.I.D. Threshold value is reflected by two blue lines on the Dynamic Activity display.\nFor Compressor and DCompressor sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) exceeds the area between the two blue lines. For Expander and DExpander sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity (18) stays inside the area between the two blue lines.\n\n\n4.1.13 L.I.D.. Maximum (34)\nWhen engaged, the threshold for the processing is determined by the maximum values from RMS/peak detection OR from the signal dynamic detection. The L.I.D. Threshold is still active, but the L.I.D. mix button is disabled.\n\nThis feature allows the whole process to be more reactive to the signal content. It worth to be tried on drum tracks."
