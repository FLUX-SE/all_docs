Designed to meet the requirements of the global broadcast and media industry it is compliant with all current worldwide loudness standards. The algorithm is highly adaptive to the structure of the incoming audio and requires only a small number of parameters to be set by the user. The result is audio compliant with the selected standard, but free of any unwanted artefacts such as pumping, breathing or distortion.\nBased on the ITU-R BS.1770(-1/2/3) standard, LevelMagic(TM) provides compatibility with EBU R128, ATSC A/85, ARIB TR-B32, FREE TV OP-59 and Portaria 354."

The algorithm is intellectual property of Jünger Audio.\nITU BS.1770-1 Loudness based measurement. Several filters and RMS weighting are used to get a loudness equivalent result. Starting from the well-known A, B, C weighting curves (DIN-IEC 651) the ITU did further research into the relationship of frequencies, their overall levels, their peak levels and the duration of signals, to develop the best representation of human loudness perception.\nITU BS.1770-2 and ITU BS.1770-3 The ITU BS.1770-1 frequency weighted measurement has been extended by a gating function.\n\nThe EBU PLOUD-Group developed a gating function to exclude quiet sections from the measurement to prevent possible loudness under-read. An example is background noise, which does not contribute to the loudness perception as much as louder signals. This gating function consists of an absolute threshold at -70LUFS and a relative threshold 10LU below the absolute gated level.\nThis involves the necessity to recalculate the whole measurement with every subsequent block.\n\nEBU R128 This is a work-to-rule based on ITU BS.1770-3.\n\nTo characterize an audio signal the measurements of Program Loudness, Loudness Range and Maximum True Peak Level are used. The Program Loudness level is normalized to -23LUFS with a permitted deviation of +/- 1LU.\nThe measurement includes a gating method as specified in ITU BS.1770-2/-3 (EBU Tech Doc 3341). Loudness Range (LRA) measures the variation of loudness over the measurement interval. It is supplementary to the measurement of overall (integrated) loudness. Units are LU (EBU Tech Doc 3342). The maximum permitted True Peak Level of a program during production is -1dBTP.\n\nSummary, Available Modes \n\n!> Important note: Systems working in ITU BS.1770-1 mode do not feature a gating function. Thus its output readings may vary from meters compliant to EBU R128 or ITU BS.1770-2/-3. Further keep in mind that the gate is only applicable to the integrated or program loudness measurement and not used for short-term or momentary measurements."

If a very loud part (above target) is followed by a quiet section (right at or below target), the recovery from damping will lead to an unnatural fade-in effect for the quiet section. In order to decrease this effect and accelerate the fade-in time, AGC Recovery can be set to [Fast] and will then be >accelerated up to fifteen times its normal speed.\nThe result sounds almost similar to if an audio engineer rides the fader to correct unwanted level jumps and thus becomes very natural and well accepted by the listener.

It is not necessary to exactly predict the level difference between the programs but already helpful to set up a few dB in the right direction.\nAn example: > The level jump from a movie to a commercial break is usually around 6dB. Resetting LevelMagic(TM) at the transition point helps to even-out the difference. Still, the process needs some attack time to build up a damping of 6dB, which can be audible depending on the program structure. If the gain is reset to a damping value between -4 to -6dB instead, the attack time is much shorter and artifacts will fall below the perception threshold.

Remember that in the output port label of the plug-in you should write the input port of your controller and in the output address of the plug-in you should write the IP address of your device."

This thread is multi-instances. This means that this will control all the instances of the plug-in. For example, if you have four LevelMagic(TM) opened, all the communication and control via OSC will be done via this one configured thread. You just have to be sure that the following parameters are well configured.\nInput Port: This is the port where the plug-in will be receiving OSC messages (the output of your control surface)\nOutput Port: This is the port where the plug-in will send feedback to (the input of your control surface).\nOutput IP Address: This is the address of destination of the outgoing OSC packets of the plug-in. You should write here the IP address of your controller\n\nThe image below presents the different OSC parameters used for configuration."

    "text": "6.6 Commands\n\n6.6.1 How to use the commands\nAt first you have to know what an OSC message is composed of. Mainly, these two parts: The Address Pattern and the Argument.\nFor controlling parameters Flux:: only supports arguments of float type so make sure that the arguments you are sending via your controller are Floats. Float arguments must always be from 0 to 1 for controlling a parameter so you don’t have to deal with scale conversion.\n\n\n6.6.2 The LevelMagic(TM) OSC commands\nWhen OSC is enabled in the Plug-in Settings (2) the file “OSC_Dict.xml” is automatically created in:\n/Documents/Flux/LevelMagic\nThis is a properties dictionary with each parameter that can be controlled and mapped using OSC. The commands in the dictionary includes a ”Translation” attribute that can be used in order translate the OSC name into the Flux:: internal parameter name in both directions.\n\n\n6.6.3 Global Commands\nGlobal commands allow you to access to some additional information. These commands don’t need an instance number. These are the available additional commands: - Address Pattern:/GetDeviceInfo - Type: Float - Value: 1 - Explanation: Get all the names of the controllable parameters\n\nAddress Pattern: /TalkToMeOnPort\nType: Float\nValue: Port Number\nExplanation: This command is very strong. It will store the IP address and the port in argument as an endpoint. All the different messages will be sent to this endpoint. This command is very useful for using many controllers.\nAddress Pattern: /GetCurrentValues\nType: Float\nValue: 1\nExplanation: This command will send all the current values of the different instances of a plug-in. The structure of the sent OSC messages is the same as the one for controlling them.\nAddress Pattern: /GetNumberOfInstances\nType: Float\nValue: 1\nExplanation: This command returns the opened number of instances of a plug-in. If you have five LevelMagic(TM) opened this command will return 5."
