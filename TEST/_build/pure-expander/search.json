    "text": "1 Pure Expander\nProduct Page | Shop Page\n\n\nPure Expander is the expander section of the Solera. An expander is used to automatically reduce the gain below the Threshold. The exclusive Dynamic Ratio algorithm developed by Flux:: allows you to remove unwanted noises or reverberation without adding a processed character to your sound. Pure Expander produces a wide range of expansion process from subtle expansions to hard noise-gate.\nThe Threshold value is expressed in dB - The plug-in compares it to the RMS (Root Mean Square or effective power) of the input signal. This value is displayed as a green rectangle on the input level meter. The level variations below the threshold are affected by the Ratio value. For a 1:1 expansion ratio, the processed signal isn’t affected by the processing: A 1 dB variation below the threshold at the input is reflected by a 1 dB variation at the output.\nTry applying a 1:3 ratio, if the input signal falls below 1 dB the threshold value, the output signal falls from 3 dB: Here is the expander action. The input signal gain is reduced by a 3:1 ratio below the threshold point.\nThe Knee sets how progressive is the start up of the compressor action – In other words, It smoothes the transition point between no processing and full processing. If the Knee value expressed in dB is increased, the progressiveness of the action will be spread below and above the threshold point.\nThe Range value sets the processing maximum action. No gain variation can exceed this value."

It is mixed with the standard compression scheme.\n\nTake a piece of full mixed music, set the ratio to 3-4 and the compression will start working. Now set the threshold of the compressor to the maximum value, the compressor will stop working because the sound level will never reach the threshold. Then increase the L.I.D.. and you will see (and hear) the compression working again!!! Now decrease or increase the input gain (in Pure Expander, or before, as you want) and you will see that the compression will continue to work equally; it’s totally, completely independent of the sound level and depends only on Ratio, Knee and sound content.\n\n\n4.9.1 How can this be used?\n\nWhen you have too much dynamic in the sound, going for e.g. from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB; If you want to compress the low levels you will hear the sound “pumping” when the sound reaches the High levels and the only thing to do with standard compressor will be to increase the threshold to rescue some airiness in the sound. But when doing that the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear some sound differences (in term density, live space, grain etc…) especially when the compressor starts working. With Solera L.I.D.., adjust the threshold and ratio on the High levels to what you think OK, then increase the L.I.D.. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen now the low levels and especially the transition between Low and High levels. You can also start increasing the ratio to increase the effect. You’ll then notice that the compression will always be active but can still take care of High, loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D..) and make the compression very smooth and no more pumping… In addition with the Dynamic Ratio function, you’ll be able to set a constant and very natural envelop that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep important transients."
