(Level Independent Detector) settings, two parameters that are kind of unique to dynamic processing, using the dynamic range content of the signal and not just the signal levels as standard dynamics processors do.\nDynamic Ratio (23) is controlling the amount of auto-ratio determined by the signal dynamics and the manual ratio setting.\nL.I.D. (25) (Level Independent Detector) controls the amount of auto-threshold determined by the signal dynamics and the manual threshold value, providing processing of the audio signal independently of the sound level and instead in regards to the signal dynamic range."

The M channel featuring the bass drum can be processed without affecting the S channel featuring the Synthesizer pad. Changing the S gain when decoding allows controlling the stereo width using MS Width (20).\nThe Solera MS mode should only be used with stereo signal and it is strongly recommended to avoid this on already MS encoded signal."

    "text": "1.3 Side Chain & Detector Equalizer\nSolera features a three band Detector Equalizer for frequency-sensitive processing. The Detector EQ does not affect the direct audio signal, but instead it applies to the signal detection channel that drives the processing, offering the option to shape the actual processing to be performed within a certain frequency range. For further control of the processing, optional external side-chain signal feeding is provided.\nEven though the Detector EQ parameters value ranges may seem extreme, with a Q-Factor up to 10, frequencies above 20 KHz and with cumulative gain, really smooth results can be achieved without deteriorating artefacts even when dealing with frequencies out of the audio spectrum. The purpose with this is to be able to use a part of the correction and include it into the audio spectrum; this is one of the secrets behind the “Air” correction often featured on vintage audio processors.\nThe wide range processing ensures a perfect accuracy in terms of phase and propagation time. Filtering the control signal upstream of the envelope gain generation allows for controlling the overall tonal balance by increasing or decreasing the processing of a particular part of the audio spectrum.\nReducing the gain for the low frequencies before the detection, increase the low frequencies in the processed signal if the processing settings reduce the gain according to the signal level. With this configuration, increasing the gain for the high frequencies makes the processing more sensitive to this particular part of the audio spectrum, and turns Solera into a sibilance controller."

Now increase the L.I.D. and you will hear the compression working again. Next decrease or increase the input gain, the compression will continue to work equally completely independent of the sound level, only depending on Ratio, Knee and sound content.\nWhen you have too much dynamic in the sound, going from -3, -6 dB Vu (or less) to +12 dB, and you want to compress the low levels, you will get a pumping effect when the sound reaches the high levels. The only thing to do with a standard compressor is to increase the threshold to retain the airiness in the sound. But when this is done the compressor will not work any more on the low levels and you will hear differences (in term density, live space, grain etc.) especially when the compressor starts working.\nWith Solera, adjust the threshold and ratio on the high levels to what you find okay, then increase the L.I.D. (from 20 to 50 %) and listen to the low levels and especially the transition between low and high levels. You can also increase the ratio for a stronger effect, and you will notice that the compression will still be present and still affect the high/loud levels (unless you set 100% L.I.D.) and make the compression very smooth with no more pumping. In addition to the Dynamic Ratio function you will be able to set a constant and very natural envelope that allows to increase low levels, low frequency and to keep the important transients."
