A mix of two different instruments, each playing an independent monophonic line, does not fall into this case, as it involves two different timbres, and the Music mode should therefore be used instead."

Pitch-tracking and extraction of overlapping notes in a reliable and artifact-free manner is currently extremely difficult to achieve and generally requires advanced user interaction.\nHere monophonic means one-note at a time, and not monaural (single channel). The plug-in itself can naturally process any channel configuration, be it mono, stereo, as well as surround recordings. The mono sum of all input channels is used for the detection.\nSometimes it is not so straightforward to decide wether the source is monophonic or not, as in the case of a complex electronic sound texture, or if a monophonic part is drenched in echo and reverberation, leading to notes that overlap in time a lot. In this case you should also try the Music setting and let your ears decide which is best."

The plugin treats the stereo input as a dual mono input, and the two channels stereo output are identical. You will most likely want to use two separate DAW channels to be processed. The most convenient way to achieve this is to create a dedicated buss , with the plugin as an insert, and two separate direct sends from each source channels to this buss, panned hard right and left. You should probably also bring the corresponding channel faders all the way down and set the send as “pre-fader” to hear the result of the processed signal only."

It is the most important parameter for all spectral domain signal transformations. It affects the capability of the algorithm to detect and identify the individual components of the signal (sinusoids, noise and transients/onsets) and to treat them independently. As general guidance, window size should be small for fast tempos and larger for slow music and at the same time larger for spectrally dense or low pitched sounds and smaller for spectrally sparse or high pitched sounds. In some cases, e.g. fast orchestral passages (that are spectrally dense and at the same time fast) the spectral and temporal characteristics ask for different windows sizes.
