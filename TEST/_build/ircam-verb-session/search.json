    "text": "2.1 Block diagram\n\nThe block diagram above shows the global structure of the reverberation engine, which governs the time-structure of the reverberation tail.\n\nThe direct (dry) signal is fed straight to the output. It corresponds to the direct sound, i.e. the direct path from the source to the listener’s ears. This is always the first part of the sound that is heard.\nThe input is fed in parallel to the early reflections generator, abbreviated EARLY. Early reflections play a crucial role in our spatial perception of sound, as they allow us to build a mental representation of the surrounding environment (locations and materials of the walls, fl oor and ceiling). These reflections vary with source position and are panned accordingly.\nThe output of the EARLY stage is fed to a second generator, named CLUSTER, which is responsible for later early reflections. These diff er from early reflections in that they come later and with increased density. This models a transition stage between early and LATE/TAIL generators. In a typical standard configuration, they are a component of the whole acoustic space with no particular localization in order to blend in seamlessly. You can however force them to be directive by changing the diffuseness parameter.\nThe LATE/TAIL stage finally generates the reverberation tail. Acoustical analysis of this component has shown it to consist of dense material, homogeneous with the whole of the reverberated space. As with CLUSTER, the diff useness parameter allows you to override this natural behavior.\n\nA good understanding of this time structure and how it affects perception of sound and space is key to be able to exploit any reverberation system to its full potential and achieve the best sonic results."

In more technical terms, this is sometimes referred to as the RT factor, which is the time at which the response of the reverberation to an input signal goes below -60dB of attenuation.\nPlease bear in mind that the master decay and high/mid/low controls are interactive, which means that the same audible result can be attained with different settings. This is intentional, as this allows you to get to the result faster and in a manner suited to your personal habits. Generally speaking, it might be more convenient to adjust the master decay time using the resulting sound as a guideline, then fine tune using high and/or low decay controls and leave the mid decay at the default setting. On the other hand, if you specifically to concentrate on the mids, for example to create a ‘hollow room’ sound, it’s easier to focus on the mid decay control, leaving hi and mid decay untouched."

Some hosts such as Logic do not report this correctly or do not support asymmetric I/O configurations In this case you have to do this manually and select amongst a number of choices of symmetric (N-to- N) and asymmetric I/O (N to stereo).\n\n\n7.6.2 Options\nThese are best left at their default in most cases, but can be changed if required:\n\nDisable processing during bypass: stops processing completely during bypass. Allows to conserve CPU when using many instances and a lot of bypass on/off automation, such as fi lm or sound effects mixing. Default is off (enabled).\nUse Multi-Thread Automation: dedicate a separate thread for automation. Useful when heavy automation is present in the project to get rid of possible audio dropouts. Default is off (processing and automation share the same thread).\nTry to avoid latency as possible: minimize latency by employing minimal buffering, possibly at the expense of a little CPU overhead. Default is on.\nReport latency: report plugin latency, if any, to the host. Some hosts have difficulty coping with large latency values, in this case you can force the plugin to report zero, but you’ll have to manually compensate for this for tracks to remain synced.
