# User Interface


As you may notice, the controls are not the usual suspects found on a dynamics processor (I/O Gain, Dry Mix and
Clipper excepted).  
Instead, the controls provided typically affect more than one parameter in the underlying algorithms, with everything 
carefully tweaked allowing for creative processing still ensuring the finest sound achievable.
