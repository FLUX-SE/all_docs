# Band Display


## Input Level Meter (57)

Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default, with auto scale depending of the threshold values.
When the MS Width section is engaged, the M (Mid) level is displayed on the left meter. S (Side) is displayed on
the right meter.

The green index reflects the threshold value.


## Output Level Meter (58)

Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default, with auto scale depending of the threshold values.
When the MS Width section is engaged, the M (Mid) level is displayed on the left meter. S (Side) is displayed on
the right meter.


## Resultant Envelop (59)

Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default.  
The scale is +/- 12 dB.

This is the compression, decompression, expander and de-expander summing envelop.

This display doesn’t directly reflect the gain changes introduced by the Bitter Sweet section which can be placed pre
or post parallel dynamic processors.


## Dynamic difference between in and out (60)

Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default.  
The scale is +/- 12 dB.

This display doesn’t directly reflect the gain changes introduced by the Bitter Sweet section which can be placed pre
or post parallel dynamic processors.


## Level difference between in and out (61)

Vu-meter not peak-meter, referenced to -16 dB Fs by default.  
The scale is +/- 12 dB.

This is the compression, decompression, expander and de-expander summing envelop which also takes account of
the input and output gains of the band.

This display doesn’t reflect the gain changes introduced by the Bitter Sweet section.

The Bitter Sweet action can be observed on the main display.


## Dynamic Activity Display (62)

No scale

The current L.I.D. Threshold value is reflected by two green lines on the Dynamic Activity display.

For Compressor and DCompressor sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity
exceeds the area between the two green lines.

For Expander and DExpander sections, the L.I.D. action is effective only when the orange Dynamic Activity stays
inside the area between the two green lines.


## Instant Release Value (63)

Auto Scale depending of the release value(s)


## Resulting Transfer Curve (64)

Auto Scale depending of the threshold value(s)
