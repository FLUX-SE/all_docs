# Special Functions

## Master Gain (13)
Adjusts the gain for the currently selected channel group.
All channel groups features an individual Master Gain control. If only one channel group is used, this control acts as
the Master Gain control for all of the channels.

For more information about channels and channel groups, see Setup (17)

Unit: dB  
Value Range: -24 / +  
Step: 0.  
Default Value: 0 dB

## X2 - Quick Gain Multiplier (14)
Multiplies the band section gain values by two.  
If the morphing slider is set in-between the parameter sections when the Quick Gain Multiplier is clicked, depending on its current position, the morphing slider will move to one of the parameter sections and the values of that
section will be re-initialized with the current values of the actual section.

## X1/2- Quick Gain Divider (15)
Divides the band section gain values by two.  
If the morphing slider is set in-between the parameter sections when the Quick Gain Divider is clicked, depending
on its current position, the morphing slider will move to one of the parameter sections and the values of that section
will be re-initialized with the current values of the actual section.

## Invert - Quick Gain Inverter (16)
Inverts the band section gain values.  
If the morphing slider is set in-between the parameter sections when the Quick Gain Inverter is clicked, depending
on its current position, the morphing slider will move to one of the parameter sections and the values of that section
will be re-initialized with the current values of the actual section.

## Master Section - Multiply, Divide, Invert (14, 15, 16)
Using the Multiply, Divide or Invert controls in the master section will affect the gain parameter for all band sections
in the selected channel group. A master section action can be combined with a specific band section action.
