# Introduction


When we started sketching our new plug-in project, our aim was to create a versatile and truly musical dynamics
processor, which handles the dynamics in a way that allows you to be creative, without a complicated user interface.  
The result is Syrah, a new generation dynamics processor utilizing real time dynamic detection and level dependent
processing, providing adaptive dynamic capabilities, which mean that Syrah is always trying to adapt to the music
and to the beat of the material.  
Using parts of our exquisite ‘BitterSweet’ technology, our new adaptive-dynamics technology, and our well-recognized 
level independent dynamics processing, Syrah will be well suited as a creative versatile processor for recording 
and mixing, as well as for delicate and demanding mastering tasks.
