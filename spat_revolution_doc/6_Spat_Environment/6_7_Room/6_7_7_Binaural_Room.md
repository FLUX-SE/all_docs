# 6.7.7 Binaural Room

The Binaural Monitoring module is great for easy channel based system monitoring. But it is not the best binaural experience we can provide with Spat Revolution.
The best way to work with binaural encoding in Spat Revolution is to use a _Virtual
Room_ which is binaurally encoding each virtual source at its exact position in a virtual space, with _Artificial Reverberation_ but without modelling any virtual speakers.
In fact, in a Binaural Room the only diffusion factor in the modelling is the _HRTF_
(see section 5.1).

Each source's direct sound plus the reverberation it creates are modelled and synthesised binaurally for _each individual source_. This advanced processing can result
in an excellent binaural experience; more precise and natural sounding than using
the Binaural Monitoring module to listen to a virtualised Channel Based rendering.
It is the preferred method to use when rendering Binaural content to disk. To do
that, you simply need to connect the binaural stream from the room directly to a
(stereo) SPAT Return path back to your DAW. You could record and listen to a Binaural Room by using two output modules, one to the recording route, and one to a
headphone output.


> â˜… For the best Binaural Monitoring try setting up two rooms, one all
Channel Based going to speakers and one Binaural for your 3D headphone mix.
