# 2.1 iLok User Account

_Flux_ uses the iLok license management system to deliver software licenses to users.
If you don’t have an iLok account yet, then please create a free iLok account at
[http://www.ilok.com](http://www.ilok.com) and download the iLok license manager.

A _Flux_ Spat Revolution license come with two activations that need to be linked to
your user account. Having two activations gives you the possibility of having a fixed
license on one particular machine and a portable license on an iLok USB key if you
own one, or a Main and Back up Spat Engine running on a live show.


> To Activate Licenses:
> - An iLok user account is required
> - An iLok USB key is optional
