![](../include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_-172.jpg)

**Reverb Enabled**

Toggles whether a source will use the reverberation engine.

**Early / Cluster / Tail**

Toggle whether a source will use only some or all of the different reverberation
stages.

_Early_ refers to _Early Reflections_ stage of the Room response which is one of the
most significant stages involved in our rapid aural perception of spatial properties
and sound source localisation.

_Cluster_ refers to a secondary iteration of room response
reflections and is quite significant in the cognition of room acoustics.

_Tail_ refers to the diffuse reverberations that eventually decay in a direct relationship
with the size and reflectivity of an acoustic space. The tail section of a reverb d≈ìs
not contribute much to the localisability of a sound source in a space, but instead
gives a sense of depth and ambience.
