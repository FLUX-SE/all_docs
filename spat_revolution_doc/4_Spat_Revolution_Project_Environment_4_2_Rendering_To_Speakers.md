# 4.2 Rendering To Speakers

In order for the virtual scene to translate correctly as an immersive sound experience in a speaker format, SPAT needs to have an accurate model of a _multi-channel
speaker arrangement_ which will be used to map the multi channel information to
the destination speakers and render the sound field correctly in a real space. To
this end, you will find a large library of standard and specialised speaker arrangements already built into SPAT which can be used in various places throughout the
**Environment Setup**.

Speaker configurations can be used to fit the format of a virtual room to match the
actual speaker system being used to diffuse the mix in a real room. Channel based
speaker configurations can also be used to transcode the format of a virtual source
into a virtual room. More about this later.

The golden rule when working with multichannel based audio is that you must be
sure to choose _exactly_ the right formats, speaker arrangements and channel routing throughout, otherwise the virtual space will not map correctly into a physical
space.
