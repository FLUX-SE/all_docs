When you open _Flux:: Center_ you will see a page that lists all _Flux_ products available for you to install. You will also find information about which version you have
currently installed on your system and which new versions might be available for
you to update to. You can select versions to install - or uninstall if necessary - using
the pull down menus. If you would like to access more installer options such as
your preferred plug-in format, please click on the gear icon to the top right of the
