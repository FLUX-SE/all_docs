# 9.7 Axis Omni Filters

![](include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_-174.jpg)

These two spectral processors can be considered as being equalisers that have
been especially designed for virtual sound emitters simulated in virtual spaces.

**Spectral Omni**

This filter section is for equalising the omni-directional part of the sound radiated
by the virtual source. This equalizer mimics the global frequency response of the
source, similar to how a loudspeaker colours the sound.

**Spectral Axis**

This filter section is for equalising the on-axis part of the sound radiated by the virtual source. Most, if not all commercially available loudspeakers do exhibit a radically different frequency response whether a listener or microphone is right in front
of it or to the side.

Setting a rather flat on-axis equalizer curve, and maybe cutting the treble and
mids for the omni response would be a good starting point to emulate a real-world
speaker, so this is the default setting for these filters.
