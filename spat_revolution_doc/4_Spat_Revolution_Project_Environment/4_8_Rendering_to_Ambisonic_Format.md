# 4.8 Rendering to Ambisonic Format

As you gain a better understanding of how Spat Revolution works and the spatialisation technologies that underpin it, you will see that one advantage it has over
other surround audio software is that the end format of your spatial sound composition, dœs not necessarily need to be fixed. In fact, when working with _Spat Virtual
Rooms_ which can output Ambisonic formats you may decide to encode a virtual
scene to disk as interleaved Ambisonic audio, which is independent of any fixed
speaker setup. You are then free to decode the Ambisonic information into any
channel based format at any given time with accurate and consistent results.

For example, an Ambisonic composition could be decoded live to any given
speaker system using Spat Revolution for the live control and spatialisation of
sources in realtime - or a pre-composed Ambisonic composition could be decoded to disk instead. In the latter case, it is possible to render versions of the Ambisonic encoded spatialisation decoded for different channel based output formats
in Spat Revolution. 

The decoded result will then be normal, multi-channel audio
files suitable for playback on a specific speaker configuration, such as 5.1 or 7.1 or
whatever deliverable format was requested. Such decoded multi channel files can
be played independently of Spat Revolution on location using a normal multichannel playback system.

always label the stems as clearly as possible!
