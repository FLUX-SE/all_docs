# 4.9 Multichannel Multiformat Audio Data

SPAT Revolution mixes, reverberates and spatializes audio from all types of microphones, arrays, high order Ambisonic captures, and from any type of pre-produced
stems, supporting a wide range of input and output audio stream formats.

When mixing in Spat Revolution - whether live on the system or off location - it is
possible to listen, decode, transcode or record a virtual scene for a specific Channel based speaker arrangement or a high definition binaural headphone mix or to
various Ambisonic formats.

A designer could render to all these output types simultaneously if the computer is
powerful enough. As we go on, we will learn more about these Spat Revolution
workflows, the technology behind them and how to use them in different contexts.
