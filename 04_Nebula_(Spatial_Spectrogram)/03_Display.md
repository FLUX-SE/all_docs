# Fading
<link type="document" target="Controls">Controls</link>
display persistence, <i>i.e.</i> the "fade to black" amount for a frame. Lowering this value retains
past particles longer, whereas increasing this make them disappear faster.

# Size factor
<link type="document" target="Controls">Controls</link>
the size of individual particles with respect to screen size.

# Blur kernel size
![](../include/BlurKernelSize.png)

<link type="document" target="Controls">Controls</link>
the radius of the blur effect applied to past particles. Particles are "smeared" more and more as
they become older, depending on this setting. Naturally, a bigger value increases the smearing, at
the expense of processing power.

> Choosing the value for this setting is really matter of taste, although please keep in mind values
that above 5 will require a sufficiently powerful graphics card in order to maintain a responsive
display.

# Particle scaling
Toggles automatic adjustment of particle size with screen size. When enabled, the overall aspect
of the display will remain similar even if the view size changes.

# Color mode
Provides the following particle-coloring modes:
* Power: the color varies according to the power of the signal in the frequency region
* <link type="document" target="Dynamics">Dynamics</link>: same as previous except this mode works on signal dynamics
* Power / dynamics: a mix of the above
* Frequency: the color varies according to frequency only, using a rainbow-palette
