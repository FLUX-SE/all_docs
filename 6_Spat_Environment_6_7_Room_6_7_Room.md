# 6.7 Room

In Spat Revolution, spatialisation of virtual sources takes places inside _Virtual
Rooms_. To enter a Room and open its graphic editor environment, you double click
on a Virtual Room module in the Setup graph, or select a room tab from the Navigation bar.

The first thing to notice, is that you can add any number of Rooms. In the screenshot above, two HOA 3D rooms are being used, each with differently designed
acoustics. There is plenty of flexibility built into Spat Revolution, in order to encompass different workflow ideas or experimental approaches. For example, the same
virtual sources may be assigned into multiple rooms, with multiple end destinations. Or as in the screen shot above, virtual sources might exist in different spaces,
that get summed together.

When you enter a Virtual Room you will see the 3D positionable editor. All connected virtual sources and their emitters will appear on the 3D scene render. On
the left side panel of the room editor, you get a list representation of each source
with its Index identification number. You can click on the Index number of each
source, and the _Source Parameter_ editor for that virtual source will appear (see section 9).

> â˜… If a source consists of a configuration of linked emitters there will be
only one index and one set of parameters for the whole cluster

Two special index items labelled as **(R) REVERB** and **(M) OUTPUT** appear fixed at
the bottom of the left panel. By clicking on these you then enter two more parameter editors, one relating to the _Artificial Reverberation_ (see section 8) and one relating to the Room output configuration and listener position editor (see section 5.4).

All sources and the entire room output can be put into solo or mute mode directly
from this index list. When you have more than one Virtual Room in your project,
then the SOURCES switch at the top left of a Room editor can be handy, as it will
show all Sources from all Virtual Rooms in the same editor - allowing you to edit,
mix, solo and mute them from one Room view.
