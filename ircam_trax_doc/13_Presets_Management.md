# Presets Management

## From the Plug-in interface

### A-B Sections

A plug-in features two preset sections : A & B. Clicking on the slot of a specific section reaches the shared preset bank.  
From the preset management window you can select the preset you want to recall in the specific preset section.

### Save

Save replaces the selected preset by a new one under the same name featuring the current settings. If you want to
keep an existing preset without your new modifications, just select an empty place into the preset list, enter a new
name for this modified preset featuring the current settings and press Save.

### Recall

Once a preset is selected from the preset list it must be explicitly loaded into the section A or the section B by using
the recall button. A preset is effective only after it has been recalled.  
Double-clicking on the preset name from the list, reloads the preset into the selected slot.

### AB Slider

This horizontal slider has no unity nor specific value display. It allows to morph current settings between two loaded
presets. A double-click on one side of the slider area toggles between full A and full B settings. The results of an in
between setting can be save as a new preset.

## From the Preset Management Window

The Presets Management Window features three preset banks:

- The Factory bank gathers presets that can’t be edited by users.
- The User bank is dedicated to the users presets.
- The Global bank features presets for A, B and morphing sections. A single global preset includes A and B section
content and the morphing slider position.

A Preset can directly be recalled into the preset section selected by the morphing slider position, by double-clicking
on its name on the list. The preset lists can be filtered. This filter is applied to any preset information such as name,
description, author, comments or key words.

The preset protection if engaged, allows only its original modification author to uncheck and edit. So you can protect your
presets in a multi-user configuration. Protected presets can only be modified using the session of their creator. If used in
another user session they can only be imported or deleted.
