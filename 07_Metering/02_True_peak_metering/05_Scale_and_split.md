#Scale &amp; split

## Scale
Meter labels are defined here as a comma separated list of dB values to
be shown on the side of the meters. This also defines where to the corresponding horizontal
markings. Default is -72;-40;-18;-9;-6;-3;-1;0;1;3.
## Colors
This lets you
customize the values at which color transitions occur. You can enter as many values as you wish, as
a comma separated list, but make sure the values are in increasing order. Default is -9;0.

The last value always defines the clip level, which will be indicated in red.
