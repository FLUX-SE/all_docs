# 5.5 Panning Algorithms

There has been a lot of scientific and artistic work to discover new methods for the
electronic reproduction of audio signals to achieve the sensory impression that
sounds are positioned in the space between speakers, rather than only coming
from a single speaker. One of the underlying mechanisms that makes it possible to
position sounds or make it seem like sounds are moving around the listener, is
conventionally referred to as _panning_.

Broadly speaking, panning is the result of an algorithm - sometimes called 'the
panning law' - that is used to calculate the amplitudes of signals sent to two or
more identical loudspeakers (or virtual sources) arranged in a particular spatial
configuration. In stereo - which we could say is the lowest resolution of speaker array - a simple panning algorithm can make the sound of a voice, for example, seem
to be placed in the air between two speakers - as if there were an invisible speaker
there. This illusion works up to a point, and breaks down if the speakers are too far
apart. With only two speakers in the system, the panning law is a simple graph
which has become quite standardised over the years. Things get more complicated when panning over 2D or 3D speaker setups and methods for spatialising on
multichannel systems are not really standardised yet. Many algorithms and standards have been advanced by the audio engineering industry, composers and
academics. 

Essentially, when we start working with multiple speakers in different
configurations, things get more complex for the panning algorithms - goals have
also expanded over time, with spatial sound design able to reach beyond simple
point source panning into fully immersive audio experiences that can be hyper-realistic or totally synthesised. Many practitioners will have their preferred methods,
but really it is up to the spatial sound designer to choose methods that seems to
give the best experience for the listener on any given type of setup. There's never
been just one way to spatialise sound. And with a powerful system like Spat Revolution, panning methods can even be combined in novel ways to achieve high quality immersive audio experiences.


**Spat Revolution lets you explore some of the most advanced
panning algorithms for surround, immersive 3D or ad-hoc
sound systems.**

In SPAT you will be able to explore some of the best panning algorithms for multispeaker setups. You can apply them in realtime and identify their characteristic differences by ear. Trying them out in realtime on a setup will help you select the
panning algorithm that is best suited for your particular project and material.

Although there are technical aspects to be interested in and aware of, you are
still invited to be creative and use your ears when deciding which are the right
panning types for your project and intended audience.
