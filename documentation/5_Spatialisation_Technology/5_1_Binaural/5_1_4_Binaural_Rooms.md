# 5.1.4 Binaural Rooms

#### �


> ★ For the best Binaural Monitoring set up two rooms, one all Channel
Based going to speakers and one Binaural for a 3D headphone mix.

The Binaural module is great for easy channel based system monitoring. But it is
not the best binaural experience we can provide with Spat Revolution. The best
way to work with binaural encoding in Spat Revolution is to use a _Virtual Room_
which is binaurally encoding each virtual source at its exact position in a virtual
space, rather than virtual speakers. In fact, in a Binaural Room there are no virtual
speakers being modelled. Instead each source's direct sound and the reverberation it creates are modelled and synthesised binaurally for _each individual source_.


This advanced processing can result in an excellent binaural experience; more
precise and natural sounding than the Binaural Monitoring module. It is the preferred method to use when rendering Binaural content to disk. To do that, you
simply need to connect the binaural stream from the room directly to a (stereo)
SPAT Return path back to your DAW. You could record and listen to a Binaural
Room by using two output modules, one to the recording route, and one to a
headphone output.
