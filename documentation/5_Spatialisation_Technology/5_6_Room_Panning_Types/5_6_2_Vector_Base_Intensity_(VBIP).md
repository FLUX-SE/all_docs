# 5.6.2 Vector Base Intensity (VBIP)

Vector Base Intensity Panning is a similar variation to the VBAP technique. It can
also reproduce a 2D or 3D immersive sound field with sharply localised virtual
sound sources.

**How does it work?**

VBIP was designed to improve on VBAP when calculating the high-frequency
(above 700 hz) localisation criteria. The selection of which speakers to use to render a virtual sound source is very similar to VBAP, only the gain calculations differ.

The same 4 dependencies mentioned for VBAP, also apply to VBIP. You will need to
listen for quite a nuanced difference between these two panning algorithms. Try to
compare how each panning type handles the higher frequency content of your
material.
