# 5.6.3 Distance Base Angular (DBAP)

As we mentioned earlier, there are a few panning algorithms that are **not** _Sweet
Spot_ dependent. Distance-base amplitude panning is one of them. DBAP is useful
in a number of practical situations such as concerts, stage productions, installations
and museum sound design where the predefined geometric speaker layouts which
immersive sound fields rely on, are not possible to establish.

**How does it work?**

DBAP localises sounds towards arbitrarily positioned speakers in a space using a
matrix based technique. It calculates signal amplitudes according to the actual positions of the speakers in a space, while making no assumptions as to where the
listeners are situated. Speaker tuning and interesting acoustic features in a room
should be utilised more when working with DBAP.

> â˜… Speakers can be freely positioned when using DBAP - look for
reflections and reverberations in a room to enhance spatial aspects.
