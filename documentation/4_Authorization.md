# Authorization

## Using iLok

Unless you purchased your license in the fluxhome.com online store, you need to activate your license.

To activate your license, please go to:  
https://www.flux.audio/activation/

When your license is activated, you need to login with iLok.com and synchronize your iLok in order to download the
new license to your iLok.

## Using Flux:: dongle

If you have purchased the license together with a new Flux:: dongle, the license is already present on the dongle
and no further action is needed.

If you already own a Flux:: dongle and purchased a new license, please login to the user download area, then follow
the instructions in the Authorization Updates section at the top of the page.

When the corresponding authorization update is downloaded you need to install the license on your Flux:: dongle.

Run the security manager and the serial number of the dongle currently plugged in to your computer will be
presented.

### Windows

SecurityManager.exe located in: C:\Program Files\Flux\Plug-ins\Misc

### OS X

SecurityManager.app is found on the download section of fluxhome.com.

Then press the Update button, select the license update that you previously downloaded, then press Open.

The active licenses are listed in the security manager, and you are now ready to start using Elixir v3.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to version 1.2, your Flux:: dongle requires an update in order to work. If
you havenâ€™t already received this update by e-mail, please contact Flux:: support, (support@fluxhome.com).
