# 3. Users and Applications

_Spat Revolution_ is aimed at all practitioners working in the medium of spatial audio
and 3D sound production - old and new. It is an expert system intended for professional use but its intuitive graphical interface invites a more diverse range of creators to engage in spatial sound production - if it is your first experience working
with spatial sound technology, _Spat Revolution_ is a great way to start out directly
with a professional quality level.

Spat Revolution spatialises and renders audio in real-time. It is used is used in:

- post production for film
- studio composition
- concert diffusion
- virtual reality
- audio for video games
- 360 video soundtracks
- 3D Audio for broadcast
- interactive sound art
- live sound mixing
- scientific research and development
- sound design for film, music and theatre
- environmental sound

In the contexts of live concerts or sound installation, the composer or sound mixer
can associate sound events with a room effect or a specific position in space. Virtual objects can be controlled on screen, or by a sequencer, a score-following system, or any other algorithmic approach. Spat can easily be linked to any remote
control device (tracking systems, tablet, smartphone, joystick, gestural sensors,
etc.) through OSC and RTTrPM interfacing protocols.


In the contexts of studio mixing and post-production, a virtual source can receive
its audio from individual channels on a mixing desk with additional controllers easily set up to allow hands on control of the positions and characteristics of virtual
sources and associated room effect. Spat Revolution can re-mix a multichannel mix
from one format in a virtual room that could be rendered in a different output format, allowing a novel approach to up- and down-mixing.

In the context of Augmented and Virtual Reality, a spatialised auditory component is essential in creating the sensations of presence and immersion in interactive virtual reality applications. In such scenarios, the B-Format and binaural 3D capabilities of Spat is particularly well suited.

An important thing to keep in mind is the long heritage and technical expertise
behind _Spat Revolution_. There are many critical factors to consider when multichannel audio is actually applied in the real world. But rest assured that the algorithms behind your spatial sound project are being implemented correctly at the
stage of the authoring and rendering environment. It is good to know that _Spat
Revolution_ is built with such a high level of technical expertise in such an intuitive
package.
