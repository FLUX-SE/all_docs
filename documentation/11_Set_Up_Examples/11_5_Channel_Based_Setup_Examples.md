# 11.5 Channel Based Setup Examples

In the following brief setup examples, we first suggest a basic signal flow graph. Of
course an actual input and output configuration may be quite different, or much
more varied depending on the project context. For example, the inputs could be
live microphone sources, or Spat SEND plug-ins or hardware routings. There then
follows a single snapshot of a Room Editor view accompanied by some short suggestions of what kind of activity and processes could be going on during such a
workflow.

These examples are by no-means fixed 'recipes' , but simply suggestions to help
develop an intuitive approach towards finding good starting points for different
types projects.
