# 9.10 Send LFE

#### �

This variable parameter will only be available when the room is a Channel Based
Format which features an LFE speaker in its configuration, such as DTU7.1 / 5.1 /
AURO and ATMOS for example.

It will send an amount of the source into the dedicated LFE speaker channel of the
output channel based configuration. Take a look at Appendix C for more sub bass /
LFE workflows.

★ **Automate the LFE send for dynamic low frequency effects**
