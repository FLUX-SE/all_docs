# 9.11 Barycentric

![](../../../include/SpatRevolution_UserGuide_-181.jpg)

These rotational transformations will only work on a virtual source that consists of
more than one emitter in a grouped channel based arrangement. They will also
become active, when you _shift-select_ mono sources together to form an ad-hoc
group or shift-select mono-sources in combination with grouped channel based
sources. The 3 dimensional group rotations are calculated using a 'barycentric
gravity' method to transform a network of sound sources constrained in a group
relationship.

**Rotation XYZ**

Rotate a group cluster around the XYZ axis of their common barycentric pivot
point.

**Scale**

Scale the group cluster, maintaining their barycentre and relative relationships.

**Relative Direction**

The barycentric transformations will continue to orient their on-axis energy towards
the listener position, if the relative direction algorithm is enabled (see section 9.6)
