# Transfer function coherence

<link type="document" target="Coherence">Coherence</link>
is a normalized - that is comprised between zero and one - measure of the confidence of the transfer
function at a specific frequency. In other words it describes how trustworthy the transfer function is
at the corresponding frequency.

at a particular frequency indicates wether the system can accurately be described as linear gain and
phase shift or not.

## Interpretation and uses
Low coherence most often indicate a bad
measurement, so you should look for possible causes and correct them before starting again.

Typical culprits include a noisy device, presence of distortion, channel crosstalk, acoustical noise
such as cooling fans, people talking, handling noise, bad isolation from the outside, etc. Low coherence
also manifests when delay is improperly compensated for.

While maximizing coherence is desirable, in most cases, it will most likely be impossible to attain a
flat curve approaching unity at all frequencies, except in an anechoic chamber or very 'dead' sounding
room with minimal reflections.

Reverberation, as well as mismatched transducers, tends to give lower coherence, as the signal arriving
at the microphone position is really the sum of several time-delayed version of the source.

Sometimes it will be impossible to get good overall coherence, and the magnitude and phase curves will
therefore be less precise, stable and smooth. This does not mean you cannot attempt extract any
information from those. As always, use your judgment and knowledge of the specific system to decide
which assumptions seem reasonable.

## Display
By default, the transparency of the main
magnitude curve is also modulated with the coherence values, which increases readability by effectively
dimming untrustworthy curve portions. In addition to controls and settings identical to those of the
spectrum magnitude curve, you can toggle the <i>coherence curve</i> on and off with the '<link

                                   target="Coherence"> Coherence</link>' in the settings.
