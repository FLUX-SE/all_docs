# Controls and display

## Display
The meter display has the following arrangement

* left bar: Momentary <link type="document" target="Loudness">Loudness</link> value

* right bar: Short-term <link type="document" target="Loudness">Loudness</link>

* text overlay: Integrated <link type="document" target="Loudness">Loudness</link> and
<linktype="document" target="Loudness">Loudness</link> <link type="document" target="Range">Range</link>
(LU) values, Gated indicator lights red when gate is active

## Pause
Clicking the ![](../../../include/Pause.png) button
pauses measurement; clicking again resumes it. This allows you to make adjustments without affecting
Integrated <link type="document" target="Loudness">Loudness</link>, instead of having to start all
over again.

## Reset
Clicking the ![](../../../include/Refresh.png) button resets the meter to its initial state.

>Don't forget to reset the <link type="document" target="Loudness">Loudness</link> meter
if you're starting playback of a new track, as Integrated <link type="document" target="Loudness">
Loudness</link>, by design, measures the overall <link type="document" target="Loudness">
Loudness</link> since the last reset. Otherwise you'd be measuring the overall <link type="document"
target="Loudness">Loudness </link> of the combined tracks, which is probably not what you want.
