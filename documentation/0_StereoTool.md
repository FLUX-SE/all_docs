 ## Channel adjustment parameters
 1 - Left channel input gain trim  
 2 - Right channel channel input gain trim  
 3 - Left channel phase invert  
 4 - Right channel phase invert  
 5 - Left channel pan pot  
 6 - Right channel pan pot  
 
 ## Stereo image adjustment parameters
 7 Stereo width
 Moving the slider to the right will enlarge the stereophonic image. To the left the image will be tightened.
   
 
 8 Stereo pan/rotation  
 Refocuses the stereo image
 
 ## Visualization and metering
 9 input peak meter  
 10 output peak meter  
 11-12 Goniometer  
 The goniometer gives informations about the phase between left and right channels. It also gives a visualisation of the stereo image width and panning.
 
 ## Goniometer interpretation
