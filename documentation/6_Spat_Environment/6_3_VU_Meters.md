# 6.3 VU Meters

Throughout Spat Revolution's different editors, you will see a complete set of accurate decibel meters giving you a visual display of all channel activity in an audio
stream, whether Ambisonic or Channel Based. They are very useful to see when
clipping might be occurring in any of the channels, and to debug signal flow routing in general.

Also, notice how the 'wire' that graphically connects Modules in the Set Up signal
graph dœs not visually change even though it is handling a load of channels.
