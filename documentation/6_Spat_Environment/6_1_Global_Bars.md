The Navigation bar appears at the top of all views. As well as links to different editor views and the Preferences, it also offers you the possibility to Mute and UnMute
Rooms.

The Status and Help bar appears at the bottom of all views. It gives information
about the status of audio connections, sample rate, block size and through latency.
Some inline help also appears here when the mouse moves over elements of the
SPAT graphical user interface. The _Provide feedback_ button sends a message directly to Flux support which automatically includes your system information for our
support team.
