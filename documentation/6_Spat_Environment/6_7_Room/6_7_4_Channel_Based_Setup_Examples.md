# 6.7.4 Channel Based Setup Examples

If the output configuration is set to be **Channel Based** , then the user must decide
on the appropriate _Panning Type_ to work with (see section 5.6). The loudspeaker
array selected in the _Speaker Arrangement_ pulldown menu will be 'virtualised' in
the Room and all the speakers will appear graphically.

> â˜… Speaker Arrangement also defines the number of output channels

The spatial composition of Virtual Sources is governed in the Virtual Room by the
characteristics of the currently selected **Panning Type** and speaker positions. In
other words, the _panning type_ is simulated inside the Room on the **Speaker
Arrangement** model. **Artificial Reverberation** (see section 8) is also modelled in
relation to the speaker arrangement in a Channel Based Room.

Additionally, the powerful _Nebula Spatial Spectrogram_ is highly dependent on the
virtual speakers model, panning type and simulated acoustics of a Channel Based
Room. Let's take a quick a look at _Nebula_ before continuing with the Room types.
