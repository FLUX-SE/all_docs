# 2.5 Beta Versions

If you would like to be closer to the most current development cycles of the software, you can enable the Beta Versions option. This will give you access to a special set of software installers from the pull down menus on the main _Flux Center_
page. Beta versions are the new builds that are still under development but may
contain useful bug fixes and new features. If you find that a Beta Version is not stable enough for you, then you can always roll back to a stable release version at any
time through the _Flux Center_ installer.

!> Try a beta on a safety copy of a project - just in case things go wrong.
