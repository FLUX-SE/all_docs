# Preset Management

LevelMagic provides two preset sections (32) referred to as section A and section B, offering simultaneous access
to two full sets of parameter settings. Clicking the A section (bottom left) or the B section (bottom right), or clicking
the arrow in the Current Selected Preset (3) display, opens a new window accessing the built-in preset manager.

## Save Preset (29)
Save replaces the selected preset by a new one under the same name featuring the current settings. If you want to
keep an existing preset without your new modifications, just select an empty place into the preset list, enter a new
name for this modified preset featuring the current settings and press Save.

## Recall Preset (30)
Once a preset is selected from the preset list in the preset manager window it must be explicitly loaded into one of
the A or B sections by using the recall button.

Double clicking a preset in the preset list automatically recalls the preset to a slot and then the preset manager window will close. Opening the preset manager clicking the A section (bottom left), recalls the preset into the A section,
opening it clicking the B section (bottom right), recalls the preset into the B section. Opening the preset manager
clicking the arrow in the Current Selected Preset (3) display recalls the preset into the section currently selected
by the Preset A/B Switch (34). Information about where the preset will be recalled is displayed to the right of the
Preset Manager label (top left in the Preset Manager window).

A preset is effective only after it has been recalled.
