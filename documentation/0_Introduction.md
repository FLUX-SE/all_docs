HEar allows faithful reproduction of a stereo or surround mix with a pair of conventional stereo headphones. It relies on
proven technology to model the various phenomena that occur when playing back audio material through a loudspeaker
system.  

This allows monitoring a full surround mix in situations when a surround-capable environment is not available or practical.
Another typical use of HEar is doing precise checking of a mix, which is convenient with headphones as these provide a
'surgical' and very detailed, microscope-like rendering of the audio.  

It can also prove very useful in a project studio context, and whenever noise isolation is a concern, as it helps achieving a
more realistic sound environment.
