# Get started

As with everything, there’s always more than one way to perform a certain task, but to understand how the processing 
reacts, and to get acquainted with Syrah, we have created this basic walk through.  
First of all, make sure all settings are at their default value (easily done by creating a new instance of Syrah).   
Then while listening:

- Increase the Amount progressively then decrease it and enable Boost.
- Increase the Amount progressively then decrease it, disable Boost and then enable Wide.
- Increase the Amount progressively then decrease it, now enable Boost again.
- Increase the Amount progressively and then decrease it.
- Then do the same all over again, but when you reach the maximum Amount, try modifying the Relax and the Relax
Bass settings.
- Now do the same once again, but when you reach the maximum Amount, or any other value that you prefer, try
increasing the Thick parameter.
- Do the same process one more time, but with Lookahead enabled, and when you find a sound that you like, disable it and toggle between enabled/disabled to feel and hear the difference.
- Finally, switch Mode, and change the Velocity setting, and repeat one or several of the above tasks, more than
once, to get a feel for how Mode and Velocity works.

Another thing that can create quite interesting results is when modifying the Input Gain with different Amount settings.

The Relax parameter is much more efficient and significant when Lookahead is enabled.

Try the invert (Inv) without Thickness on drums or other percussion, you will pretty soon find out that this can create
some very interesting results..

With the Gain Comp enabled, Syrah will adjust the Output Gain, which can make it easier to compare with the incoming signal and understand the changes you have made on the sound. And then you can enable the clipper to
increase the Output Gain and make your sound louder.

## And some extra tricks

As Thickness is completely level independent, and since it’s not adding any compression, you can add a lot off
thickness and still fine tune the amount of compression by doing the following:

- Set Amount and Thickness to 100 %
- Enable the gain Link control
- Now start decreasing the Input Gain

Now you will see and hear the Thickness acting, but the compression will decrease. Now try it again, but make sure
to adjust all the other parameters to get the kind of processing you want first.

Another little trick, is to decrease the Amount up to round about 50 %, this will be particularly interesting when in
"Dynamic Deep" Mode.

## Have fun!


Now you should have a basic understanding of how the processing works, but never forget that Syrah tries to adapt
to material you are processing and the result can be astonishingly different for a voice than for a bass or for drums,
or a keyboard, guitar etc. and of course, for a complete mix...
